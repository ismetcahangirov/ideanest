 *
 * Two of the values below are per-environment: the origin the application talks
 * to, and the origin whose links it claims. A static `app.json` would hard-code
 * production into every build, which is the same mistake `lib/seo/sitemap/config.ts`
 * refuses on the web — a staging build that advertises production URLs is a lie
 * somebody eventually believes. The variable names are deliberately the web's
 * own, so a deployment answers "where is the API" once rather than twice.
