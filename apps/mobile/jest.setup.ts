 * depends on the default platform, so the suite passed on Windows and failed on

 * available on ios`. Mocking one module at a time was whack-a-mole through that
 * tree: `expo-glass-effect` was replaced and `expo-router/toolbar` failed next.
 *
 * <h2>It makes the tests better rather than merely greener</h2>
 *
 * A test of `ProjectCard` is a test of a card. Rendering the real navigator to
 * assert an accessible name is rendering a navigation container to check a
 * string, and it asserted nothing about the destination — the `href` went
 * unchecked because there was nothing to read it off.

 * The `Link` below is a host element carrying its `href`, so a test can assert
