/**
 * MMKV is a native module. It has no JavaScript fallback by design — that is
 * the point of it — so under Jest it must be replaced rather than loaded.
 *
 * The replacement is a real `Map` and not a stub returning `undefined`, because
 * the code under test is a cache: a store that forgets everything makes an
 * offline test pass for the wrong reason. `src/lib/storage.ts` is the only
 * module that imports MMKV, so this mock has exactly one consumer.

/**
 * Reanimated is NOT mocked here, and that is deliberate.
 *
 * `react-native-reanimated/mock` re-exports the real module before replacing
 * parts of it, so requiring it pulls in the worklets native binding and throws.
 * `jest.config.js` points Jest at `react-native-worklets/jest/resolver.js`
 * instead, which makes the package resolve to its JavaScript half — so the real
 * Reanimated runs, `FadeInDown` is a real animation object, and a component that
 * misuses one fails here rather than on a device.
