/**
 * `jest-expo`, and why this package alone in the repository is not on vitest.
 *
 * Every other workspace runs vitest, and that is still the right default. React
 * Native is the exception for a mechanical reason rather than a preference: its
 * source ships untranspiled, with Flow annotations, and the transform that
 * strips them is `babel-preset-expo` — the same one Metro uses. A runner that
 * does not go through Babel meets `import type Foo from ...` in
 * `react-native/index.js` and stops at the first import of the framework.
 * `jest-expo` is that Babel transform plus the platform mocks, maintained by the
 * people who ship the SDK.

/*
 * `jest-expo`'s pnpm allowlist, EXTENDED RATHER THAN REPLACED.
 *
 * The preset's first pattern is
 * `/node_modules/(?!(.pnpm|react-native|@react-native|expo|@expo|...))`: every
 * package it names is compiled on the way in, and everything else in
 * `node_modules` is left alone. `.pnpm` is in that list, which is what makes the
 * preset work in this repository at all.
 *
 * It stops working one directory deeper, and that is the whole bug. pnpm stores
 * a package at `node_modules/.pnpm/<name>@<version>/node_modules/<name>/`, so
 * every real file has a SECOND `/node_modules/` in its path — and the pattern is
 * unanchored. `.pnpm` satisfies the lookahead at the first one; at the second the
 * next segment is the package's own name, and for anything not in the list the
 * pattern matches and the file is skipped.
 *
 * Nothing noticed while every dependency outside the list shipped CommonJS.
 * `@shopify/flash-list` 2.3 ships ESM, so `campaign-list.test.tsx` stopped at
 * `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` on a line nobody
 * had touched.
 *
 * So the package is added to the preset's own allowlist rather than a
 * hand-written list replacing it — the distinction the note below is about. A
 * future dependency that ships ESM is one more name here, and the throw is what
 * turns a change in the preset's shape into a message instead of a silently
 * un-extended list.
