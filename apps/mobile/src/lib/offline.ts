/**
 * Offline caching — issue #115. **Saved campaigns and pledges readable without a
 * connection.**
 *
 * <h2>Persisting the query cache rather than building a second one</h2>
 *
 * The alternative was a local database mirroring the API, written on every read
 * and queried by the screens. That is a second source of truth for every field
 * on a campaign, with its own migrations and its own staleness rules, and the
 * screens would have to decide which of the two they were rendering. Persisting
 * TanStack Query's own cache means the screens never know: `useQuery` answers
 * from the cache it already answers from, and the only difference offline is
 * that the background refetch fails.
 *
 * <h2>Synchronous, which is the whole reason MMKV is the store</h2>
 *
 * A persister backed by `AsyncStorage` restores after the first render, so the
 * first frame a backer sees on a plane is the empty state — and then it fills
 * in. MMKV reads on the calling thread, so the cache is already there.
 *
 * <h2>What is persisted, and what is deliberately not</h2>
 *
 * Only the queries #115 names: what somebody saved, what they backed, and the
 * campaigns behind those. Everything else — discovery feeds, search results,
 * suggestions — is dropped by {@link shouldPersistQuery}. A feed is a ranking
 * computed at a moment; restoring last week's is worse than showing that the
 * device is offline, because it looks current. Nothing personal beyond those two
 * lists is written either: this store is unencrypted (see `lib/storage.ts`), so
 * what goes in it is what a backer could screenshot anyway.
