/**
 * The device's own answer to "is the owner here?" — issue #29.
 *
 * <h2>This is a LOCAL GATE, and it is not an authentication factor</h2>
 *
 * Face ID succeeding proves that whoever is holding the phone can unlock the
 * phone. It proves nothing to the service, which never hears about it: the
 * refresh token in `lib/session.ts` is what authenticates, and biometry only
 * decides whether this application is allowed to read it back out. Treating a
 * successful prompt as a second factor would be a mistake that is hard to undo —
 * the platform's real second factor is §17.1's TOTP, which the service verifies,
 * and `lib/auth.ts` carries the challenge for it.
 *
 * The practical consequence is the shape of every function here: none of them
 * returns a credential, a token or a claim. They return whether the operating
 * system said yes, and the caller decides what to do about it.
 *
 * <h2>Two layers, and only one of them is this file</h2>
 *
 * The stronger gate is the keychain's own: `lib/session.ts` writes the refresh
 * token with `requireAuthentication`, so the operating system refuses to hand
 * the bytes over without a successful prompt whether or not this application
 * asks for one. That gate cannot be bypassed by anything running in JavaScript,
 * which is what makes it worth having.
 *
 * What this file adds is the part the keychain cannot do: **telling the truth
 * in the interface before anybody commits to it.** A settings screen offering
 * "require Face ID" on a device with no enrolled biometry would produce a
 * keychain item nobody can ever read, and the failure would arrive as a lost
 * session rather than as a refused setting. {@link biometricCapability} is what
 * that screen asks first.
 *
 * <h2>Why the failure reasons are not passed through</h2>
 *
 * `authenticateAsync` distinguishes `user_cancel`, `system_cancel`,
 * `app_cancel`, `lockout`, `not_enrolled` and more. Every one of them means the
 * same thing to the caller — the session stays locked — and the ones that differ
 * are already covered: {@link biometricCapability} answers "not enrolled" before
 * a prompt is ever shown, and a lockout is the platform telling somebody to use
 * their passcode, which the prompt itself offers. So {@link unlock} answers a
 * boolean, and the screens have one case rather than seven.
