/**
 * Where the session lives on a phone — §16's `Authorization: Bearer` with the
 * refresh token in secure storage, behind #29's biometric gate.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not `lib/storage.ts`</h2>
 *
 * The web keeps its refresh token in a `SameSite=Strict; HttpOnly` cookie, which
 * JavaScript on the page cannot read at all. A phone has no equivalent, so the
 * nearest true thing is the platform keychain: Keychain Services on iOS, the
 * Android Keystore behind `EncryptedSharedPreferences`. Both are backed by
 * hardware on any device this application supports, and both survive an
 * application update while MMKV's plain file does not deserve to hold a
 * credential in the first place.
 *
 * <h2>Access token in memory, refresh token on disk</h2>
 *
 * The access token lasts fifteen minutes (§16.2) and is never written down. A
 * fifteen-minute credential in persistent storage is a credential that outlives
 * the reason it existed: the process restarting is exactly the moment to go and
 * get a fresh one, and the refresh token is what makes that free.
 *
 * <h2>#29: TWO KEYCHAIN ITEMS, AND ONLY EVER ONE OF THEM AT A TIME</h2>
 *
 * The biometric lock is not a check this application performs and could forget
 * to perform. It is a property of where the token is kept: with the lock on, the
 * token lives in an item written with {@code requireAuthentication}, and the
 * operating system refuses to return the bytes until a prompt succeeds.
 * JavaScript cannot go around that, which is the entire reason to prefer it over
 * an `if` somewhere in this file.
 *
 * The two items cannot be one item. Expo's own note is explicit that
 * {@code requireAuthentication} "would not work in tandem with the
 * {@code keychainService} value used for the other non-authenticated
 * operations": the authenticated entry is generated against a different key, so
 * turning the lock on or off is a **move** between two entries rather than a
 * flag on one. {@link enableLock} and {@link disableLock} are that move, and
 * both delete the source only after the destination has been written — a
 * failure half-way leaves a readable session rather than a lost one.
 *
 * <h2>Whether somebody is signed in must be answerable WITHOUT a prompt</h2>
 *
 * `SavedScreen` and `PledgesScreen` ask that question on mount, to decide
 * between a list and an invitation to sign in. Answering it by reading the
 * keychain would show a Face ID sheet to somebody who opened the Saved tab —
 * every cold start, before they asked for anything. So the fact that a session
 * exists is kept as a boolean in `deviceStore` and the token is fetched only
 * when a request actually needs one.
 *
 * That boolean is <strong>not</strong> a credential and does not weaken
 * `lib/storage.ts`'s rule about what may go in MMKV. Anything that can read it
 * already has the application's sandbox and learns only that somebody is signed
 * in — which the presence of a keychain entry tells it anyway. It is also not
 * authoritative: {@link storedRefreshToken} clears it when the keychain turns
 * out to disagree, which is what a revoked Android key or a restored backup
 * looks like from here.
