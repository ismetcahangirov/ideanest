/**
 * The maintenance trigger — issue #150.
 *
 * <h2>The signal is a 503, and that is a decision rather than a discovery</h2>
 *
 * The service has no maintenance mode: nothing in `apps/api` answers "down for maintenance",
 * and the web's `/maintenance` page says in its own comment that whatever switches traffic to
 * it is a deployment concern. What a planned outage looks like from a phone is therefore
 * whatever the edge returns while the service is away — and a reverse proxy's maintenance
 * page, like a load balancer with no healthy upstream, answers `503 Service Unavailable`,
 * usually with a `Retry-After`. So **any 503 from the API is treated as maintenance.** No
 * handler in the service returns 503 for a reason of its own, so the rule has no false
 * positive today; if one ever does, it must carry a problem `code` and this is where the rule
 * narrows to "503 without one".
 *
 * <p>Not while offline. A 503 that arrives while the platform says there is no internet is a
 * captive portal or a carrier proxy speaking, and telling somebody on hotel Wi-Fi that
 * IdeaNest is under maintenance would be a false statement about the service.
 *
 * <h2>A store, like the session's</h2>
 *
 * The request that sees the 503 is deep inside `api/client.ts` and has no router; the root
 * layout has a router and sees no responses. A module-level flag with subscribers, read
 * through `useSyncExternalStore`, is the seam between them — the same shape as
 * `lib/session.ts` and `lib/locale.ts`.

 *
 * Public, small, and cheap for the service — the cheapest read in the contract that goes
 * through the whole stack rather than stopping at a health probe the edge might answer on its
 * own. It is fetched **without** the session: `sessionFetch` refreshes a missing access token
 * before the first call, and with the biometric lock on that is a Face ID prompt every thirty
 * seconds on a screen that is only waiting. A thrown `fetch` is "not yet": the connection went,
 * the service did not come back.
 *
 * <h2>Never from a cache</h2>
 *
 * The service marks this response `public, max-age=3600`, so the platform's HTTP cache
 * (OkHttp's, `NSURLCache`) or a CDN would happily answer the poll with the 200 it stored before
 * the outage. The screen would leave, the next real read would meet the 503, and it would be
 * pushed again — a loop. So the request says `no-store`, sends `Cache-Control: no-cache` for
 * the intermediaries, and carries a query string no cache has seen.
 *
 * <p>Below 500 rather than "not 503": a 502 or 504 is the edge saying the service is still not
 * there, and leaving on one would send the reader straight into it.
