/**
 * Signing in, refreshing, and signing out on a phone — issue #29's other half.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not in `@ideanest/api-client`</h2>
 *
 * That package's own docblock says it: "no token handling, no refresh, no
 * retry… they are decisions about a session rather than about a request, and
 * mobile's will differ". They do differ, in the two ways that matter. The web
 * holds its refresh token in a `SameSite=Strict; HttpOnly` cookie and asks for
 * `tokenDelivery: "cookie"`; this asks for `"body"` — the shape #24 built for
 * exactly this client — and puts what comes back in the platform keychain.
 *
 * <h2>REFRESH IS SINGLE-FLIGHT, AND IT IS NOT AN OPTIMISATION</h2>
 *
 * §17.1: a refresh token rotates on every use, and a token that is presented
 * twice is treated as stolen — the whole session family is revoked. Two
 * concurrent refreshes present the same rotated token, which is indistinguishable
 * from theft, so they do not merely waste a request: they end the session.
 *
 * A phone produces that situation far more readily than a browser does. Four
 * tabs of a feed, a saved list and a pledge list all resume together when
 * somebody unlocks their phone, and TanStack Query refetches every stale query
 * at once. All of them meet a fifteen-minute-old access token in the same
 * millisecond. {@link refreshAccessToken} is therefore one promise shared by
 * every caller until it settles, which `auth.test.ts` asserts by driving twenty
 * simultaneous callers and counting one network call.
 *
 * <p>The lock adds a second reason. With #29 on, a refresh reads a keychain item
 * that presents a biometric prompt; two of those would be two prompts stacked on
 * top of each other, and on Android the second is refused outright.
 *
 * <h2>What a failed refresh means</h2>
 *
 * The service has already revoked the session by the time it answers, so there
 * is nothing on this device worth keeping — {@link refreshAccessToken} clears
 * both halves before returning null. The one case that is deliberately NOT a
 * sign-out is a prompt the reader dismissed: {@code storedRefreshToken} returns
 * null without having asked the service anything, and the session stays where it
 * is so that "not now" does not mean "sign in again".
