/**
 * Whether anybody is signed in on this device, and whether the gate is armed.
 *
 * <h2>Why a hook rather than a provider</h2>
 *
 * Four screens ask, and all four ask the same question of two synchronous
 * booleans. A context provider would add a tree-wide re-render for a value that
 * changes a handful of times in a session, and it would have to be threaded
 * through the root layout in front of the query client — where it would delay
 * the first frame on a cold start for something the first frame can read
 * directly.
 *
 * <h2>`useSyncExternalStore` and not `useState` + `useEffect`</h2>
 *
 * Before #29 this hook read the keychain in an effect and held the answer in
 * state, which was two problems. The read is asynchronous, so every screen
 * flashed "sign in" for a frame; and the state was per-component, so signing in
 * on one screen left the others showing the old answer until something else
 * re-rendered them. `session.ts` publishes changes now, and this subscribes:
 * one source of truth, read synchronously on the first render, and every screen
 * moves together.
 *
 * <h2>What this is NOT</h2>
 *
 * It is not authentication. It answers "is there a session on this device",
 * which is enough to decide whether to show a sign-in prompt or a list, and
 * nothing more: the token can be revoked, and only the service knows. A screen
 * that showed private data on the strength of this alone would be showing it on
 * the strength of a file on the device. Every read that matters still goes
 * through `api/client.ts` and is still refused by the service without a valid
 * bearer.

/**
 * The snapshot, cached.

 * change on every render and loop until React gives up with "The result of
 * getSnapshot should be cached". The object is therefore rebuilt only when one
 * of its three fields actually differs.
