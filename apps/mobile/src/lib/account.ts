 * - `signed-out`: no token on the phone, or the service said 401/404 to a credential that
 *   was presented (revoked, or the account is gone);
 * - `unknown`: a token is on the phone and the service could not be asked — offline, a
 *   5xx, or the biometric lock not yet (or not) unlocked. Nothing account-shaped is drawn, and above all the shell does **not**
 *   fall back to "Sign in": that would offer a sign-in button to somebody who already has
