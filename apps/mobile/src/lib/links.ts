/**
 * Deep links and universal links — issue #114. **A shared campaign link opens
 * the app when installed.**
 *
 * <h2>Three ways in, one answer</h2>
 *
 * A campaign can arrive from a push notification (`ideanest://…`, the custom
 * scheme, which needs nothing from any server), from a link somebody pasted into
 * a message (`https://ideanest.az/projects/…`, which iOS and Android only hand
 * over after they have fetched and believed the association files), or from a
 * cold start where the operating system passes the URL that launched the
 * process. All three end up here, because a link that opens a different screen
 * depending on which of the three it was is a link that gets reported as broken
 * once a month for ever.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a pure function and not Expo Router's own parser</h2>
 *
 * Expo Router can map an incoming URL to a route by itself, and it does — this
 * is not a replacement for it. What it cannot do is refuse: its matcher will
 * happily route a link from a host this application has nothing to do with, and
 * on Android an implicit intent from any installed application can carry one. So
 * the URL is checked here, against the host this build claims, before it is
 * handed over. Being pure is what lets that check be tested without a simulator.
 */

export type Destination = { readonly pathname: string };

/**
 * The campaign path shape, on both the web and here.
 *
 * `apps/web` serves a campaign at `/projects/<creator>/<campaign>`, and this
 * application renders it at the same path — so the universal link that opened
 * the app and the route it lands on are the same string, and the `pathPrefix` in
 * `app.config.ts` guards one shape rather than two.

 * is to let the browser keep it — or an application trying to drive this one
 * somewhere. Silently landing on the feed makes both look like they worked.
