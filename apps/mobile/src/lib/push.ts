 * Push notifications, the phone's half — issue #87.
 *
 * <h2>The permission is asked for at the moment it means something</h2>
 *
 * <p>Not on launch. A permission sheet shown before somebody has seen a campaign is a
 * sheet they decline, and on iOS a declined permission cannot be asked for again from
 * inside the application — the only way back is Settings, which almost nobody walks.
 * {@link registerForPush} is therefore called from the screens where a notification has
 * an obvious purpose, and never from the root layout.
 *
 * <h2>A registration is worth nothing without a session</h2>
 *
 * The service registers a token against the account making the call, so a registration
 * attempted while signed out has nobody to belong to. This refuses rather than storing it
 * for later, because "later" is a queue of one entry that has to be flushed at sign-in and
 * cleared at sign-out, and getting the clearing wrong is how somebody's notifications
 * arrive on a phone they signed out of.
