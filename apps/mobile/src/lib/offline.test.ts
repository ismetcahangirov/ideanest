/**
 * Issue #115: saved projects and pledges readable without a connection.
 *
 * <p>The two properties that make that true rather than nearly true are asserted here.
 * The first is that the right queries survive a restart and the wrong ones do not — a
 * restored discovery feed looks current and is not. The second is `offlineFirst`: without
 * it TanStack Query pauses a query when the device reports no connection, so a cached
 * campaign sits behind a spinner that never resolves, which is the exact failure #115
 * exists to prevent and the one that unit tests usually miss.
