/**
 * The root of the application — issue #110.
 *
 * <h2>What lives here and why nothing else does</h2>
 *
 * Four providers, in an order that is not arbitrary. `GestureHandlerRootView`
 * has to be the outermost native view or a gesture started in a child never
 * reaches the handler. `SafeAreaProvider` measures the insets every screen below
 * reads, and measuring them twice — which is what a second provider deeper in
 * the tree does — gives half the screens the wrong answer on a device with a
 * notch.
 *
 * `PersistQueryClientProvider` rather than the plain one is the whole of #115's
 * wiring: it restores the cache before the first render and writes it back as
 * queries settle. See `lib/offline.ts` for what it will and will not keep.
 *
 * <h2>The link handler is here because a cold start has no screen yet</h2>
 *
 * Expo Router resolves an incoming URL to a route on its own. What it does not
 * do is refuse one, and on Android any application can send an implicit intent
 * carrying a URL. `lib/links.ts` decides; this listens. Both entry points are
 * covered — `getInitialURL` for the launch that started the process, and the
 * `url` event for a link that arrives while the application is already open —
 * because a link that works only when the app is already running is the bug
 * #114 is most often filed about.

/**
 * The link inside a push payload, or null when there is not one.
 *
 * <p>`PushComposer` puts exactly one key in `data`, and a payload from anywhere else has
 * no business steering this application — so anything that is not a string is dropped
 * here, and anything that is still has to survive `destinationFor`.

     * opened from a notification and one opened from a shared link land on the same
     * screen by the same code — which is the whole of what #114 asks for, and what stops
     * the two drifting into "works from a link, does nothing from a notification".
