/**
 * Discovery — issue #112's first half.
 *
 * <h2>What the screen decides, and what it does not</h2>
 *
 * The ranking is the service's (§6.2's `DiscoverySort`), the paging is
 * `useDiscoveryFeed`'s, and the virtualisation and the stagger cap are
 * `CampaignList`'s. What is left here is the order in which the four possible
 * states are answered, and that order is the only thing on this screen anybody
 * gets wrong:
 *
 *   1. **Cards, if there are any** — including cards from a previous fetch while
 *      the next one is in flight. A list that empties itself on every refetch is
 *      a list that flickers.
 *   2. **The error**, but only when there is nothing to show. An error banner
 *      over a working list is noise; an error instead of a working list is a
 *      regression.
 *   3. **Loading**, on the first fetch only.
 *   4. **Empty**, which means the service answered and there is genuinely
 *      nothing — a real fact about the platform rather than a failure.
