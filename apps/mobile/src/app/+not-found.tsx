 * route it names. `lib/links.ts` refuses a link from a host we do not claim
 * before it gets here; what reaches this screen is one of ours that this build
 * does not know about, and the useful thing to offer is the way back rather than
 * an apology. The action is a white pill, as on the web's failure pages.
