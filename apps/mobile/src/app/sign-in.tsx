/**
 * Signing in on a phone — issue #29's prerequisite, and part of the same change.
 *
 * <h2>Why this screen exists in the biometric-unlock issue</h2>
 *
 * #29 is a gate on a session, and nothing on this platform created one on a
 * phone: the backend has had registration, rotation, social sign-in and
 * two-factor since #23–#26, and no client drove any of it. The issue's own
 * comment says so — "biometric unlock re-opens an existing session; it does not
 * create one" — and names it a prerequisite belonging to no issue. Shipping the
 * gate without it would have been a feature that cannot fire.
 *
 * <p>It is deliberately the smallest sign-in that is honest: an address, a
 * password, and §17.1's second factor when the account has one. Registration,
 * password reset and the provider buttons stay on the web, which is where a
 * verification email lands anyway.
 *
 * <h2>The two-factor challenge never reaches a URL</h2>
 *
 * It is a credential for the next few minutes. `apps/web`'s `TwoFactorChallenge`
 * carries the full argument for why the challenge is a state of this form rather
 * than a route: a query string is written to logs, kept in history, and
 * forwarded in a `Referer`. Here there is no history and no referer, and the
 * reason still holds — a deep link is a URL, and #114 will happily route one.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * `docs/motion-system.md` §5 gives authentication no entry animation. Nothing on
 * this screen fades, and `FadeUp` is not imported.
