/**
 * The service, as this application talks to it.
 *
 * <h2>Absolute URLs, unlike the web client</h2>
 *
 * `apps/web` calls `/v1` as a relative path so that the browser treats it as
 * same-origin and attaches a `SameSite=Strict` cookie. There is no document
 * here, no origin, and no rewrite, so every request goes straight to the origin
 * the build was given. That also means there is no cookie: the session is a
 * bearer token from the keychain, which is what `lib/session.ts` exists for.
 *
 * <h2>Why the client is built per request rather than once</h2>
 *
 * `createApiClient` takes its headers at construction, and two of ours change:
 * the access token when a refresh lands, and the language when somebody changes
 * the phone's. A module-level singleton would capture whatever was true at first
 * import — which, for the language, is before the first screen has rendered.
 * Constructing one is an object literal and a closure; it is not worth caching
 * something that would be wrong.
 *
 * <h2>#29: the session lives in the `fetch`, not in the headers</h2>
 *
 * The access token is set on the request by {@link sessionFetch} rather than
 * passed to `createApiClient`, and that is the difference between a client that
 * works for fifteen minutes and one that works. A header fixed at construction
 * is a header fixed *before* the refresh that a 401 triggers, so a retry would
 * present the token that had just been refused. Reading it inside the fetch
 * means the retry carries the token the refresh produced.
 *
 * <p>It also puts the whole of the session's request behaviour in one place: a
 * cold start with no token in memory refreshes *before* the first call rather
 * than spending a guaranteed 401 to discover it, and a 401 refreshes and retries
 * exactly once. `@ideanest/api-client` stays what it says it is — headers in,
 * bodies out — and this is the seam it left open.
 */

/**
 * `fetch`, with the session on it.
 *
 * <h2>One retry, never two</h2>
 *
 * A second 401 after a successful refresh is a **refusal**, not an expiry: the
 * token was minted moments ago, so the service is saying this account may not
 * have that resource. Retrying again would be a loop against an answer that will
 * not change, and the caller gets the 401 to render. `apps/web`'s
 * `authorizedFetch` draws the line in the same place and for the same reason.

   * the moment the first private read is made, rather than after a failure.
