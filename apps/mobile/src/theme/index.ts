/**
 * The mobile styling layer — issue #111. **Same values, same names, no second
 * palette.**
 *
 * <h2>Why this file holds no colour of its own</h2>
 *
 * Everything below is re-exported from `@ideanest/design-tokens`, which is the
 * package whose own header says it exists for React Native. A second palette is
 * not a hypothetical: it is what happens the first time somebody needs a slightly
 * darker card on a phone, writes the hex inline, and nobody notices because the
 * web build never renders that screen. `theme.test.ts` fails on a hex literal
 * anywhere under `src/`, which is the same guard `packages/ui` runs and the
 * reason a designer can still read the token file as the whole truth.
 *
 * <h2>Why NativeWind is not here</h2>
 *
 * §14.3 names NativeWind 4, and NativeWind 4 drives Tailwind 3. This repository
 * is on Tailwind 4 everywhere — `apps/web` and `packages/ui` both — and
 * NativeWind's Tailwind 4 release is `5.0.0-preview`. The two available choices
 * were therefore a second, older Tailwind major with its own config dialect
 * living beside the current one, or a preview dependency underneath every screen
 * in a new application. Neither buys anything that `StyleSheet` over these tokens
 * does not: the values are identical either way, and the class names would be a
 * second spelling of them rather than a second source.
 *
 * The moment `nativewind@5` is stable this becomes worth revisiting, and the
 * revisit is cheap because the tokens — not the class names — are what the
 * screens import. `docs/architecture.md` §14.3 carries the same note.

/**
 * The type scale, in points.
 *
 * `docs/ui-kit.md` §5.2 expresses the four largest steps as `clamp()`, which has
 * no React Native equivalent and no meaning on a phone anyway: a viewport-width
 * interpolation exists so a heading can grow on a desktop, and there is no
 * desktop here. Each of those steps therefore takes **the small end of its own
 * clamp**, which is the value the web already renders at phone widths — so the
 * two platforms agree at the only width both of them draw.
