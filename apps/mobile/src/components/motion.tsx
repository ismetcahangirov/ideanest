/**
 * The one scroll-entry animation — `docs/motion-system.md` §4.1 and §7, and
 * CLAUDE.md §2's "one scroll-entry animation, `FadeUp`, everywhere".
 *
 * <h2>Why there is exactly one component here</h2>
 *
 * A second entry animation is a design change rather than an implementation
 * detail, and the way a codebase acquires one is never a decision — it is a
 * screen that needed something slightly different and had a whole animation
 * library within reach. Having one exported component makes the second one a
 * diff somebody has to justify.
 *
 * <h2>Transform and opacity only</h2>
 *
 * `FadeInDown` moves on `translateY` and fades on `opacity`, both of which are
 * composited on the UI thread by Reanimated. §8's rule is not about elegance:
 * animating `height` or `top` runs layout on every frame, on the JavaScript
 * thread, in a list that is already scrolling.

/**
 * Whether this device has asked for less motion.
 *
 * Built on `AccessibilityInfo` rather than on Reanimated's `useReducedMotion`,
 * for two reasons. It is the platform's own answer — "Reduce Motion" on iOS,
 * "Remove animations" on Android — rather than a library's reading of it, and it
 * is a core React Native API, which means it behaves under Jest instead of
 * needing the animation runtime that does not exist there.
 *
 * The subscription matters as much as the initial read. Somebody who turns the
 * setting on because a screen is making them ill should not have to restart the
 * application for it to take effect.
