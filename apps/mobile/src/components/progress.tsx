/**
 * A campaign's funding progress — `docs/ui-kit.md` §7.11.
 *
 * <h2>Lime means urgent. Success means achieved.</h2>
 *
 * CLAUDE.md §2 states it and this is the component where getting it wrong tells
 * a backer the opposite of the truth: a campaign still asking for money is lime,
 * and one that reached its goal is `--success`. A single token swapped here
 * turns "hurry" into "done" on every card in the feed.
 *
 * <h2>Colour is never the only signal</h2>
 *
 * The percentage is printed beside the bar, and the whole control carries an
 * accessible label saying what it means in words. Somebody who cannot
 * distinguish lime from green — and somebody using a screen reader, who sees no
 * colour at all — reads the same fact.

/**
 * The fill's test identifier.

 * test bolted on — and a literal repeated in both places is one that gets renamed in one
 * of them.
