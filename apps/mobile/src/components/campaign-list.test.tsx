/**
 * Issue #112's actual requirement: **capped stagger so long lists never crawl.**
 *
 * <p>Two separate caps, and both are needed. `staggerDelay` bounds the delay at 300ms, so
 * the fiftieth card does not wait two and a half seconds. {@link ANIMATED_PREFIX} bounds
 * how many cards animate at all, and that one is this component's: FlashList recycles
 * rows, so an `entering` animation keyed off an absolute index replays halfway down a list
 * somebody is already reading, and fifty animated cards in a feed produce visible jank
 * (motion-system §8).
