/**
 * The two rules from CLAUDE.md §2 that this component is where you break.
 *
 * <p><strong>Lime means urgent, success means achieved.</strong> One token swapped here
 * tells a backer that a campaign still asking for money has already made it, on every
 * card in the feed.
 *
 * <p><strong>Colour alone never carries meaning.</strong> The difference between the two
 * states has to survive a screen reader and a person who cannot tell lime from green.
 *
 * <p>Every `render` is awaited: it is asynchronous from `@testing-library/react-native`
 * v14 onwards, and a forgotten `await` yields a promise whose query functions are simply
 * missing — which reads as the library being broken rather than as a missing keyword.
