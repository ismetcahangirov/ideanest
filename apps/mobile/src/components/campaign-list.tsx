/**
 * A virtualised list of campaigns — issue #112. **Capped stagger so long lists
 * never crawl.**
 *
 * <h2>Why FlashList and not FlatList</h2>
 *
 * §14.3 names it, and the reason is what a discovery feed is: a list of cards
 * with an image, of unbounded length, that somebody flicks through fast.
 * `FlatList` keeps every rendered row mounted and recycles nothing, so the
 * fiftieth flick is measurably worse than the first on a mid-range Android
 * phone — which is most of this market.
 *
 * <h2>The stagger cap, and why the index it uses is not the list index</h2>
 *
 * `docs/motion-system.md` §7 caps the entry delay at 300ms because the fiftieth
 * item must not wait two and a half seconds. That cap alone is not enough here,
 * and this is the part that is easy to get wrong: FlashList RECYCLES rows, so
 * item 200 is rendered into the component that held item 3, and an `entering`
 * animation keyed off the absolute index would replay — a card fading in halfway
 * down a list somebody is already reading.
 *
 * So the animation is applied only to the first screenful. Beyond
 * {@link ANIMATED_PREFIX} rows the cards are mounted plain, which is also §8's
 * "no animation in long lists" rule and the reason scrolling stays at frame
 * rate. The entry animation exists to make a screen arrive; it has nothing to
 * say about row 60.

 * How many rows fade in. About two screenfuls on a phone, which is what somebody
