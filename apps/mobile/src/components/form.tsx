/**
 * The three controls a form on this platform needs — issue #29.
 *
 * <h2>Why these are here rather than in `@ideanest/ui`</h2>
 *
 * That package is React DOM: its `Field` renders a `<label>` and wires
 * `aria-describedby`, neither of which exists in React Native. The tokens are
 * shared and the markup cannot be, which is the split `src/theme/index.ts`
 * already describes — so this file is the native half of the same design, and
 * the values in it all come from `../theme`.
 *
 * <h2>Accessibility, and where it differs from the web</h2>
 *
 * React Native has no `<label for>`. What it has is `accessibilityLabel` on the
 * input itself and `accessibilityLabelledBy` on Android only, so the label text
 * is passed to the field AND set on the input — a visible label a sighted reader
 * uses, and the same words announced to a screen reader. A field whose label
 * exists only as a `Text` above it is announced as "text field", which is the
 * native equivalent of the unlabelled input `docs/ui-kit.md` §7.13 refuses.
 *
 * <p>An error is announced as well as coloured. `accessibilityRole="alert"` on
 * the message and `aria-invalid` on the input, because CLAUDE.md §2 forbids
 * colour carrying meaning on its own and a red border is exactly that.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * `docs/motion-system.md` §5 gives authentication and account settings no
 * entry animation and 150ms of colour on controls. The pressed state below is
 * an immediate colour swap for that reason — React Native applies it on the
 * same frame — and there is no `FadeUp` on any screen that uses this file.
