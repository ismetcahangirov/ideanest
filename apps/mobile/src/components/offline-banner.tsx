/**
 * The global offline banner — issue #150.
 *
 * <h2>Where it renders: each navigator's `screenLayout`</h2>
 *
 * "Under the header" is a different place on every screen: the tabs draw their header in
 * JavaScript, the root stack's is native, and a modal has its own. A banner positioned by
 * the root would have to know each header's height. `screenLayout` — which both Expo Router's
 * `Stack` and `Tabs` pass to React Navigation — wraps each screen's *content*, and a screen's
 * content starts where its header ends, so the banner lands under whichever header the screen
 * has without measuring any of them.
 *
 * <p>The root stack skips screens whose header is hidden (`headerShown: false`). Those are the
 * tab group — whose own `screenLayout` draws the banner under the tab's header, where a second
 * one from the root would sit above it — and the full-screen failure states, which are not
 * something being read from a cache.
 *
 * <h2>The words are the banner; the stripe is the reminder</h2>
 *
 * It is {@link OfflineNotice} — a warning stripe **and** a sentence, never the hue alone
 * (CLAUDE.md §2) — laid across the top of the screen. Screens with cached data keep showing it
 * underneath (`offlineFirst`, `lib/offline.ts`); screens without show their own error.
 *
 * <h2>Announced once, when the connection drops</h2>
 *
 * The outer view is an Android live region (`polite`) that is always mounted and starts empty,
 * so the sentence appearing inside it is a content change TalkBack reads — once, when it
 * appears, and not on a launch that is already online, where it never appears. iOS has no live
 * regions; there {@link OfflineAnnouncer} says it, from one place in the root, so the banners
 * mounted on every screen of the stack do not each announce it.
