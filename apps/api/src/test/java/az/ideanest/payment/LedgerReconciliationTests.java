/**
 * §8.4's {@code ledger-reconciliation} — issue #70.
 *
 * <p>A plain unit test: the whole of it is arithmetic over two queries, and the point of
 * separating {@link LedgerReconciliation} from its job was to make that testable without a
 * scheduler or a database.
 *
 * <p>WHAT THESE COVER, and each is a way the platform's money can be wrong that the others
 * would not catch:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>the books balance.</strong> V41's deferred trigger should make an unbalanced
 *       posting impossible, which is exactly why a check for one is worth having: it can only
 *       fail for a row that arrived past both the application and the trigger.
 *   <li><strong>no account holds a sign it cannot.</strong> Two errors of opposite sign
 *       balance perfectly, so the first check would pass over a creator who had been paid
 *       twice. {@code AccountTotal} names that case as alert-worthy in as many words.
 *   <li><strong>the ledger agrees with the transactions.</strong> The only one of the three
 *       that catches a posting the application never made at all.
 *   <li><strong>a discrepancy is not a failed job.</strong> Throwing would make the runner
 *       back off and eventually stop scheduling — which is the wrong response to having found
 *       something.
 *   <li><strong>a pass that has never run says so.</strong> A reconciliation that silently
 *       stops looks exactly like a platform whose books balance.
 * </ul>
