/**
 * §9.2's phase two and §9.6's schedule, end to end (#64, #65).
 *
 * <p>This is where a campaign stops being an obligation and becomes money, so the
 * properties asserted here are the ones whose absence is expensive in a way nothing else
 * on the platform is:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #aSuccessfulCampaignIsQueuedAndCollected()} — the whole of §9.2's phase
 *       two, including the ledger posting and the receipt.
 *   <li>{@link #aSecondPassDoesNotQueueTwice()} — queuing twice would reset every
 *       backer's attempt count and hand four fresh attempts to cards already refused four
 *       times.
 *   <li>{@link #aCollectedPledgeIsNeverChargedAgain()} — the failure that charges somebody
 *       twice.
 *   <li>{@link #anUnreachableProviderDoesNotCostAnAttempt()} — §9.6 gives four chances at a
 *       card, not four chances at a network.
 *   <li>{@link #anUndecidedChargeKeepsItsIdempotencyKey()} — §9.3's R-08, which is the only
 *       thing standing between a re-poll and a second charge.
 *   <li>{@link #aDeclineIsRecordedWithItsCode()} and
 *       {@link #theWindowElapsingDropsThePledge()} — §9.6's schedule from the first refusal
 *       to the drop.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The jobs are driven directly with the instant to judge against;
 * {@code application-test.yml} sets both schedules to {@code -} for the reason every job
 * in this codebase does, and with a sharper one here — a timer firing in the background
 * would charge the very pledges a test is about to assert are uncharged.
 *
 * <p><strong>Nothing is torn down.</strong> V41 makes {@code transactions} and
 * {@code ledger_entries} append-only in PostgreSQL and both reference the pledge and the
 * campaign, so a suite that has collected anything cannot delete either — the database
 * refuses, which is the property those triggers exist for. Every test therefore mints its
 * own campaign and scopes every assertion to it.
