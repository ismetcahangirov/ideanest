/**
 * §20.4's campaign close, under load and under contention — issue #141.
 *
 * <h2>What this measures, and what it deliberately does not</h2>
 *
 * §20.4's target is <strong>10,000 collections within ten minutes</strong>, a sustained
 * floor of 16.7 a second. That figure has two halves and they belong to different owners.
 *
 * <p>The half that is <strong>ours</strong> is everything between "a pledge is due" and
 * "the money is recorded, posted and announced": the claim under {@code FOR UPDATE SKIP
 * LOCKED}, the transaction that spans the provider call, the ledger posting, the outbox
 * write, and §9.6's schedule. That half is what runs here, against a provider that answers
 * instantly, on a real PostgreSQL. If it cannot clear 16.7 a second with <em>no network at
 * all</em>, no provider will rescue it, and the measurement is worth having on every run
 * rather than on the day somebody wonders.
 *
 * <p>The half that is <strong>not</strong> ours is the provider's latency, its rate limit
 * and its retry semantics. #60 has not chosen one, and §9.3 records that the four
 * candidates differ enough that a number measured against a guess would be a
 * threshold-bearing artefact describing code that is not IdeaNest. So <strong>no
 * end-to-end throughput SLO is asserted here</strong>. What is asserted is the floor our
 * own path must clear for the provider's latency to be the only remaining variable, and
 * the measured rate is logged so a regression is visible as a number rather than as a
 * feeling.
 *
 * <h2>Why this was blocked, and why it is not any more</h2>
 *
 * #141's blocking comment said "there is no close-and-collect run to load test yet — the
 * migrations stop at V21, `charge-processor` is named in comments and not written". That
 * is no longer true: #64 and #65 built {@code CollectionOpening}, {@code CollectionRun},
 * {@code ChargeProcessorJob} and {@code ChargeRetryJob}, and V41 and V42 built the tables
 * under them. The remaining objection in that comment — a mock PSP — is answered by
 * scoping the assertion to our own half rather than by waiting.
 *
 * <h2>Correctness matters more than throughput here, and is asserted exactly</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>No double collection.</strong> {@link #theRunIsExactUnderContention()}
 *       drives {@value #WORKERS} threads at one campaign's queue — which is what two
 *       replicas do — and asserts one charge per pledge and one transaction row per
 *       pledge. This is the failure that charges somebody twice.
 *   <li><strong>No lost pledge.</strong> Every one of {@value #PLEDGES} ends in exactly one
 *       of §9.6's two outcomes, and the set that was refused is the set the rule says
 *       should have been.
 *   <li><strong>Exact decimal amounts.</strong> The ledger is compared against a
 *       {@code BigDecimal} sum, never a double.
 *   <li><strong>The outcome is never revisited.</strong> §5.1 decides success at the
 *       deadline from the confirmed pledges. A collection failure reduces the payout and
 *       must not flip the campaign, so the frozen outcome columns are read before and
 *       after.
 *   <li><strong>§9.6's schedule survives the load.</strong> Every refused pledge is at
 *       attempt one with its next slot at +24 hours, and the retry sweep collects all of
 *       them under their own keys.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>The decline rate is a rule, not a script</h2>
 *
 * §9.6 puts 5–15% of a campaign's cards on the failure path, and a stub that always
 * approves never exercises it. The threads claim pledges in an order nobody controls, so
 * a queued script would make the outcome depend on that order;
 * {@code ScriptedPaymentProvider#willDeclineFirstAttemptForOneIn} refuses on a function of
 * the pledge instead, which the test computes independently and compares against.
 *
 * <h2>Scale</h2>
 *
 * {@value #PLEDGES} pledges rather than ten thousand, deliberately. What §20.4 constrains
 * is a <em>rate</em>, and a rate is what this measures; running ten thousand would multiply
 * the wall time of every CI run by the one variable — provider latency — that is stubbed
 * out to zero here anyway. The floor asserted is §20.4's own, unscaled.
