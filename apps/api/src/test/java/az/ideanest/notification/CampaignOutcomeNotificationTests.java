/**
 * A campaign closes, and everybody who is owed a message gets one.
 *
 * <p>The whole path, end to end and with no fixture standing in for any part of it: the
 * deadline passes, {@code campaign-finalizer} applies §5.1, the outbox event it records is
 * relayed, the notification module recognises the event type, resolves the audience
 * through {@code shared.audience}, and writes a row per recipient per channel.
 *
 * <p><strong>Driven this way deliberately.</strong> Recording the event by hand — which is
 * what {@code NotificationAudienceTests} does, correctly, because its subject is the
 * audience port — would leave the one thing #63 and #85 could still get wrong untested:
 * that the producer writes the event type the consumer switches on. Nothing in either
 * module fails to compile when those two strings disagree, and the symptom is a campaign
 * that closes and tells nobody.
