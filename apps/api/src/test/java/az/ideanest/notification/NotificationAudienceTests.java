/**
 * An audience the platform computes: that "goal reached" reaches the people who funded it.
 *
 * <p>#245's whole complaint. #85's fan-out resolved one recipient per event, taken from the
 * payload, so {@code GoalReached} notified the creator and nobody else — "the least useful half
 * of that event: the people who funded it hear nothing". The port
 * {@code shared.audience.ProjectAudiences} is what changes that, and this suite is what makes it
 * a guarantee.
 *
 * <p>The rows go in through the real path — pledges in the table, an outbox event, the relay, the
 * fan-out — because the property being asserted is that the pledge module's definition of a
 * backer and the notification module's audience are the same set. A fixture that decided who the
 * backers were would be asserting its own opinion.
 *
 * <p>The ones that carry the design:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #goalReachedTellsTheCreatorAndTheBackers()} — the feature.
 *   <li>{@link #aDraftIsNotABacker()} — the one place this definition deliberately differs from
 *       V17's active set, and the difference matters: telling somebody who abandoned a checkout
 *       that the campaign succeeded implies their card is about to be charged.
 *   <li>{@link #aCreatorWhoBackedTheirOwnCampaignIsToldOnce()} — the deduplication is
 *       load-bearing. Without it the second insert violates
 *       {@code notifications_event_recipient_channel_key}, which rolls back a dispatch every
 *       other consumer of the event shares, for ever, because no redelivery changes the audience.
 *   <li>{@link #anAudienceOverTheBoundIsTruncatedAndTheCreatorSurvives()} — the bound exists, and
 *       what it cuts is not the one recipient certain to want the message.
 * </ul>
