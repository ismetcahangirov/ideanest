 * asks {@code MessageSource} for a key per type; a missing key throws, a key with a
 * placeholder nothing fills renders the placeholder, and a key referring to a fact its
 * type does not carry renders a hole in the middle of a sentence. None of those is
 * visible until somebody receives the message, and one of the messages is "your payment
 * failed".
 *
 * <p>So every type is rendered, all the way through both layouts, and the result is
 * checked for the shapes an unfinished template leaves behind.

 * <p>Parameterised over the enum rather than listing the types, deliberately: a type
 * added to {@link NotificationType} joins this suite without anybody remembering to add
