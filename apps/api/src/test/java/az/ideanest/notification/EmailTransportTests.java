/**
 * That an email actually goes out, and that what goes out is a message a client can read.
 *
 * <p>Everything here runs through the real {@code EmailChannelSender} against a real SMTP
 * server ({@code MailServerStub}), because the properties worth asserting are properties
 * of the bytes: both parts of the {@code multipart/alternative}, the subject, the
 * {@code Message-ID}. A mocked {@code JavaMailSender} would prove the code called
 * {@code send}, which nobody doubted.
 *
 * <p>The other half is what is written down about it. {@code email_deliveries} is the
 * only record of what the transport did, and V30's header is emphatic about what it may
 * and may not claim — so these tests check the row as well as the mailbox, and in
 * particular that a suppression and a refusal are told apart.
 *
 * <p>The ones that carry the design:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #theMessageIdIsDerivedFromTheNotification()} — the queue is at-least-once
 *       by design, so what makes a duplicate harmless is that the second copy carries the
 *       first one's identifier. Nothing else on this side can prevent it.
 *   <li>{@link #anAnonymisedRecipientIsSuppressedAndDeadLetteredAtOnce()} — the third
 *       outcome {@code ChannelSender} did not have, and the reason it was added: eight
 *       retries against a deleted account is a retry budget spent on a settled question.
 *   <li>{@link #aRefusedSendIsRecordedAndRethrown()} — a refusal is recorded and then
 *       propagated, because the dispatcher is what counts attempts. A transport that
 *       swallowed it would have the notification recorded as sent.
 * </ul>
