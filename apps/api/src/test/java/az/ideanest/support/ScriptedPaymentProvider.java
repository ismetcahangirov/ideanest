/**
 * A payment provider a test writes the answers for.
 *
 * <p><strong>This is the stub §9.2 refuses, and it is allowed here for exactly the
 * reason it is refused there.</strong> §9.2's objection is that an adapter returning an
 * approval "would make this path look finished and would have told clients that cards
 * were verified when no card was ever seen" — an objection about a deployed environment
 * and about what clients are told. In the suite nobody is told anything and nothing is
 * deployed; what a scripted provider buys is the only way to exercise §9.6's decline
 * schedule, the circuit breaker, and the ledger posting before #60 is answered.
 *
 * <p>It lives in {@code src/test} for that reason and no other, and
 * {@code PaymentProviderBoundaryTests} asserts that {@code src/main} contains no
 * implementation of {@link PaymentProvider} at all.
 *
 * <h2>How a test uses it</h2>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * provider.willApprove();               // every charge from now on
 * provider.willDecline("insufficient_funds");
 * provider.willBeUnavailable();
 * provider.nextCharge(approval());      // one answer, then back to the default
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Answers queued with {@link #nextCharge} are taken first, one per call; the default
 * set by the {@code will…} methods answers everything after them. That split is what
 * lets a test say "the first two attempts fail and the third succeeds" without writing a
 * counter.
