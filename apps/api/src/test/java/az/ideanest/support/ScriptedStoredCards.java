/**
 * A saved card for every pledge, unless a test says otherwise.

 * <p>{@code payment_methods} is #55 and does not exist, so the shipped
 * {@code UnavailableStoredCards} answers "there is no card on file" — which is true of
 * the platform and fatal to any test of collection, since every attempt would be
 * refused with {@code payment_method_missing} before a provider was asked.
 *
 * <p>The default is a card. {@link #withoutACard} is how a test asks for the platform's
 * real answer for one pledge, which is worth being able to do: a pledge whose card has
 * gone is a case §9.6's schedule has to handle, and it is the only case a deployed
 * environment can produce today.
