 * Puts a campaign into the state a test needs to start from, by writing the row.

 * into {@code LIVE} is the four requests a creator actually makes — submit,
 * approve, launch, and a moderator to do the middle one — and
 * {@code ProjectLifecycleApiTests} takes it, because that path is what it is
 * checking. A suite about reward tiers is not: driving every one of its fixtures
 * through moderation would make each of its tests depend on the moderation
 * configuration and on a second account sharing one rate limiter, for a campaign
 * whose state is a precondition rather than a subject.
 *
 * <p>What is written is exactly what the launch transition writes — the state, the
 * launch instant, and the deadline computed from the duration — so the row that
 * results is one the application could have produced. Every check constraint on
 * {@code projects} still applies, including
 * {@code projects_public_states_are_fully_specified}, which is why the goal and the
 * duration are filled in here when the campaign has none.
 *
 * <p>What is <em>not</em> written is the audit row. A campaign launched this way has
 * a history that does not mention its launch, so a test that reads
 * {@code project_state_transitions} must not use this.
