/**
 * The payment log is ordered by the column it displays — issue #412.
 *
 * <h2>What was wrong</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code /admin/payments} describes itself as newest first, and AD-05 on the console index
 * says the same. It was ordered by {@code id}, on the argument that a UUID v7 carries the
 * millisecond it was minted in (§7.3), so the key and {@code created_at} say the same thing and
 * only one of them is unique.
 *
 * <p>They are written by two different clocks. The identifier is minted in the application when
 * {@code PaymentTransaction} builds the row; {@code created_at} is {@code DEFAULT now()} (V41)
 * and is the database's, taken when the insert lands. A charge that mints its key before a
 * provider call and commits after it, two instances whose clocks differ, and anything migrated
 * in with a key from elsewhere all put the two orders out of step — and {@code PaymentLogView}
 * renders the timestamp while the query ordered by the key.
 *
 * <p>#404 found the same defect on {@code audit_logs} and
 * {@link AuditTrailOrderingApiTests} is what pinned it there. This suite is that one applied to
 * the console surface that is entirely money, where it costs more: the rows are retry attempts
 * against somebody's card and <strong>the order is the evidence</strong>. §9.6 permits four
 * collection attempts, and "declined, declined, collected" read in the wrong order is a
 * different story about the same pledge.
 *
 * <h2>How this suite reproduces it</h2>
 *
 * <p>By writing rows the way the two clocks disagree: inserts whose {@code created_at} runs
 * backwards while their identifiers run forwards. Every row goes in through SQL, because
 * {@code created_at} is {@code insertable = false} on the entity precisely so that no caller
 * can choose it — which is the right rule and makes the disagreement unreachable through the
 * application.
 *
 * <p><strong>The rows are cleaned up, and the teardown is not optional.</strong> V41 puts a
 * trigger on {@code transactions} that raises on UPDATE and DELETE, so an ordinary
 * {@code DELETE} will not do it — {@code Ledgers.clear} turns the trigger off for the length
 * of the delete and back on in a {@code finally}, and {@code ConsoleReadApiTests} does the
 * same thing beside this file for the same reason. This is the half where
 * {@link AuditTrailOrderingApiTests} genuinely cannot follow: its table refuses DELETE and
 * TRUNCATE with no trigger to disable, so it leaves its rows and hides them behind an invented
 * entity kind.
 *
 * <p>Leaving them here would not be untidy, it would break somebody else's suite. A campaign
 * cannot be deleted while a transaction references it, and a member of staff cannot be deleted
 * while a campaign references them — {@code projects_creator_id_fkey} is
 * {@code ON DELETE NO ACTION} — so three rows left behind by this file make
 * {@code DELETE FROM users} fail in {@code IdentitySchemaTests}, which has nothing to do with
 * payments and no way to find out why.
 *
 * <p>Each test still writes against a campaign of its own and every assertion reads
 * {@code ?projectId=}, which is belt and braces rather than redundancy: it keeps a test honest
 * about which rows it is asserting on even while the whole table is its own.
