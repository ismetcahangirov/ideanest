/**
 * "What did this person do last Tuesday" — #404's date range on the audit trail.
 *
 * <h2>What was missing</h2>
 *
 * <p>The trail filtered by entity kind, by one entity, and by one actor. It had no date
 * range, on the argument that the order <em>is</em> the date — the identifier carries the
 * millisecond it was minted in (§7.3) — so "since Tuesday" was reading pages until the dates
 * stopped being interesting.
 *
 * <p>Both halves of that were wrong. The first is the ordering defect
 * {@link AuditTrailOrderingApiTests} covers: the key and {@code occurred_at} are written by
 * two different clocks, so the identifier does not stand in for the date at all. The second
 * is what an operator actually does with an audit log — the question the surface exists to
 * answer is about a person and a day, and answering it by paging through everything since is
 * not reading.
 *
 * <p>The range costs nothing to serve, which is why it is here and a filter on the action is
 * not: every one of V21's four indexes ends in {@code occurred_at DESC}, so a bound on that
 * column narrows the scan whichever shape the query had already chosen.
 *
 * <h2>The actor filter is tested here too, and had no control until #404</h2>
 *
 * <p>The service has accepted {@code actorId} since #314 and the screen offered no way to set
 * one, so the trail's central question was reachable only by editing the URL. The endpoint's
 * behaviour is asserted here; the control that reaches it is {@code AuditTrailView}'s.
 *
 * <h2>Rows are written through SQL, and none of them is cleaned up</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code occurred_at} is {@code insertable = false} on the entity precisely so that no
 * caller can choose it, and V21 puts a trigger on the table that raises on DELETE and
 * TRUNCATE. So every row this suite writes is there for the rest of the run — they carry an
 * entity kind no production action uses, and every assertion filters to it.
