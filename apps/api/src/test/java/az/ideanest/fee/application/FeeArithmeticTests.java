/**
 * What a fee schedule does to a sum of money — §9, issue #311.
 *
 * <p><strong>CLAUDE.md makes this suite non-optional:</strong> "money arithmetic, state
 * transitions, idempotency and stock reservation are not optional to test — they fail
 * silently and expensively". A fee is the multiplication that stands between what a backer
 * paid and what a creator receives, and it is wrong in ways nobody notices until a creator
 * adds their statement up by hand.
 *
 * <p><strong>In the package it tests</strong>, because {@code FeeSchedules.apply} is
 * package-private: the arithmetic is separated from {@code priceOf} so that it can be
 * checked without a database, and widening it to public purely to be testable would
 * publish a method whose contract is "you have already resolved the schedule".
 *
 * <p>Deliberately a plain unit test with no container. {@code FeeSchedules.apply} takes an
 * entity and a {@link Money} and returns a breakdown; none of the rules being checked here
 * are about persistence, and a test that needed PostgreSQL to assert that three numbers add
 * up is a test people stop running.
