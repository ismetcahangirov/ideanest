/**
 * The dual-approval rule, asserted against the service rather than the browser — issue #398.
 *
 * <h2>What was wrong, and why nothing caught it</h2>
 *
 * <p>A payout requiring two signatures could be left {@code APPROVED} with one, by approving
 * it and then withdrawing that approval. {@code withdrawApproval} called {@code
 * Payout.payable()} to put it back, and {@code payable()} only transitions from {@code
 * CALCULATED} — so from {@code APPROVED} it returned without doing anything, and the guard
 * that called it compiled, ran and had no effect. {@code send()} then gated on the state
 * alone and never counted the signatures.
 *
 * <p>The only thing standing in the way was {@code PayoutQueue} in the browser, which
 * disables its send control while the count is short: a client-side check in front of a
 * service that would have accepted the call. {@code PayoutApprovalTests} does assert that
 * {@code payable()} is a no-op from {@code APPROVED} — correctly, because the queue read
 * calls it on every row it lists — and never sees the service that relied on it not being
 * one. The gap was between the two.
 *
 * <p>So these are service-level, and they are the transitions CLAUDE.md names as not
 * optional to test: they "fail silently and expensively".
 *
 * <h2>The rows are written rather than earned</h2>
 *
 * <p>A payout produced by {@code calculate} needs a closed campaign, settled charges and a
 * fee schedule in force, none of which is what is under test here — this is about what
 * happens to {@code state} and {@code payout_approvals} once a payout exists.
 * {@code ConsoleReadApiTests} makes the same trade for the same reason.
