/**
 * The state machines behind money leaving the platform — issues #67, #68, #69.
 *
 * <p>CLAUDE.md: "money arithmetic, state transitions, idempotency and stock reservation are
 * not optional to test". These are the transitions. Each one is a rule that is invisible
 * when it is right and expensive when it is wrong — a payout that could be sent twice, a
 * refund that could be retried on a row that already settled, a dispute whose resolution
 * date survived it being reopened.
 *
 * <p>Plain unit tests over the entities. What the database enforces is asserted by the
 * schema suites; this is the half that fails at the call site, where a reader can see which
