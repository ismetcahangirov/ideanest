/**
 * The guarantee (#134): a scheduled job fires on every replica and runs on one.
 *
 * <p>Against a real PostgreSQL, because the whole of this is PostgreSQL deciding
 * which of two callers won a conditional update. An in-memory database that accepts
 * the same SQL would prove nothing about the case that matters, which is two
 * connections issuing it at the same moment.
 *
 * <p>Four of these carry the design:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #twoConcurrentTriggersRunTheJobOnce()} is the issue, checked against
 *       two real connections rather than described.
 *   <li>{@link #aLeaseLeftBehindByADeadHolderIsReclaimed()} is the other half of it:
 *       a lock nobody released is an outage, and the expiry is what makes the
 *       recovery automatic.
 *   <li>{@link #aStaleHolderCannotReleaseSomebodyElsesLease()} is the failure that
 *       makes an expiring lease worth having rather than dangerous.
 *   <li>{@link #consecutiveFailuresReachTheTerminalState()} is the bound: a job that
 *       cannot run stops being retried and says why.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Every claim here is driven with the instant it should be judged against, for
 * the reason {@code ReservationCleanerJob} gives about its own sweep: waiting for a
 * lease to elapse would make the suite slow, and waiting for a backoff would make it
 * flaky on the machine that is busiest.
