/**
 * What each role confers, and what the separation is for — issue #295.
 *
 * <p>#295 states the problem the old configured list had in one line: it "cannot express
 * 'may refund' against 'may moderate'". These assertions are that sentence, checked — a role
 * model whose roles all confer everything is the list it replaced, spelled differently.
 *
 * <p>A plain unit test: none of this is about persistence. What is in the database is which
 * roles an account holds; what each role means is a policy in {@link StaffRole}, and that is
 * exactly the thing a reviewer should be able to see change in a diff.
