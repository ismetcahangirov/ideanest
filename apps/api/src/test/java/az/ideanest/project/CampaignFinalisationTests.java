/**
 * §5.1 at the deadline: what {@code campaign-finalizer} decides, and what it freezes.
 *
 * <p>#63. This is the point at which a campaign stops being a page and becomes an
 * obligation, so the properties asserted here are the ones whose absence costs money:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #aFundedCampaignSucceedsAtItsDeadline()} and
 *       {@link #anUnderfundedCampaignDoesNot()} — the rule.
 *   <li>{@link #aCampaignThatRaisedExactlyItsGoalSucceeds()} — the boundary, which is the
 *       one case nobody checks by hand and the one creator who would never forgive it.
 *   <li>{@link #aLaterCollectionFailureDoesNotChangeTheOutcome()} — #63's own sentence,
 *       and the entire reason V29 exists.
 *   <li>{@link #aSecondPassChangesNothing()} — closing a campaign twice would publish a
 *       second event, which is ten thousand duplicate messages about somebody's money.
 *   <li>{@link #closingIsAnnounced()} — a campaign that closed and told nobody is the
 *       same defect as one that did not close.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The job is driven directly with the instant to judge against, rather than by waiting:
 * {@code application-test.yml} sets the schedule to {@code -} for the reason every job in
 * this codebase does, and with one of its own — a sweep firing in the background would
 * close the very campaigns these tests are about to assert are still live.
