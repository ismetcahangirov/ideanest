/**
 * The transition table, checked against the specification rather than against
 * itself.
 *
 * <p>{@link #SPECIFICATION} is transcribed from {@code docs/architecture.md} §6.1
 * by hand. That is the point: a test that read the edges out of
 * {@link ProjectStateMachine} and compared them with themselves would pass for any
 * table at all, including one where a suspended campaign can go live again. Two
 * independent statements of the same rule are what makes a disagreement between
 * them visible.
 *
 * <p>Because the specification lists every state, the comparison also covers every
 * transition that is <em>not</em> allowed — all two hundred and fifty-six ordered
 * pairs — rather than a sample somebody chose.
 *
 * <p>A plain unit test. The state machine needs no Spring and no database, which is
 * why it was written as a table in the first place.
