/**
 * The lock table, checked against the specification rather than against itself.
 *
 * <p>{@link #SPECIFICATION} is transcribed from {@code docs/architecture.md} §5.3
 * and §6.1 by hand, for the reason {@link ProjectStateMachineTests} gives: a test
 * that read the table out of {@link ProjectEditLocks} and compared it with itself
 * would pass for any table at all, including one that lets a live campaign move its
 * goal. Two independent statements of one rule are what makes a disagreement
 * between them visible.
 *
 * <p>Because the specification lists every state and every rule, the comparison
 * covers what is <em>not</em> locked as well — all eighty pairs — rather than a
 * sample somebody chose. Nine of those pairs are what stops a creator repricing a
 * reward somebody has already bought.
 *
 * <p>A plain unit test. Which fields are frozen is a function of one enum value,
 * which is why it was written as a table in the first place; asserting it needs no
 * Spring context, no database, and no campaign.
