/**
 * §6.1's scheduled launch, which nothing performed until #389.
 *
 * <p>The state machine has carried {@code APPROVED → SCHEDULED → LIVE} since it was written
 * and the campaign editor tells a creator their cleared campaign "goes live when you launch
 * it, or at the launch time you set". Only the first half was true, and
 * {@link #aCampaignWhoseTimeHasComeOpens()} is the second half as a test.
 *
 * <p>The rest are what a sweep over other people's campaigns has to get right:
 * {@link #aCampaignWhoseTimeHasNotComeIsLeftAlone()} and
 * {@link #aCampaignWithNoLaunchTimeIsLeftAlone()} — a creator who chose to press the button
 * themselves must not have it pressed for them — and
 * {@link #aSecondPassChangesNothing()}, because opening a campaign twice would announce it
 * twice to everybody following the creator.
 *
 * <p>The job is driven with the instant to judge against rather than by waiting:
 * {@code application-test.yml} sets the schedule to {@code -}, for the reason every job in
 * this codebase does.
