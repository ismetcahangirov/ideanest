/**
 * The bridge between §4.3's five words and §6.1's sixteen states.
 *
 * <p><strong>This test is the reason the module may use strings.</strong>
 * {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} forbids {@code discovery} from importing
 * {@code project.domain}, so {@link DiscoveryStatus} names states as text. A test
 * class is not a module and may import both, so the agreement between the two is
 * checked here rather than assumed — a state renamed in {@link ProjectState} and not
 * here would otherwise be a filter that silently stops matching anything, and a state
 * <em>added</em> there and not here would be a campaign that is neither shown nor
 * hidden on purpose.
 *
 * <p>A plain unit test: it reads two enums and needs no database.
