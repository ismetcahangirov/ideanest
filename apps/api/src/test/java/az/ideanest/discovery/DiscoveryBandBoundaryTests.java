/**
 * The edges of every band, which is where a band filter is actually wrong.
 *
 * <p>Testing the middle of a band tests nothing: {@code 37%} lands in "25–50" under
 * any reading of the boundaries, including three wrong ones. What decides whether the
 * bands partition the feed or overlap it is the value that sits exactly on a
 * boundary — and a campaign counted in two bands is counted twice in the facet panel,
 * while one counted in none disappears from a filter that should have found it.
 *
 * <p>Every band in this module is <strong>closed below and open above</strong>. §4.3
 * writes "under 25%, 25–50%, 50–75%, 75–100%, over 100%", which leaves three boundary
 * values in two bands and the fourth in none; half-open intervals are the only
 * reading under which the five partition the line.
 *
 * <p><strong>Exactly 100% is "over 100".</strong> The question a backer is asking is
 * "did it make it", and a campaign standing exactly at its goal did. Filing it under
 * "75–100" would file a funded campaign under "nearly".
