/**
 * <strong>The most important test in this change.</strong>
 *
 * <p>Discovery is the only endpoint that lists campaigns nobody asked for by name.
 * Everything else in the platform is reached through an identifier somebody already
 * has, and is guarded by an authorisation check written for that one request. This is
 * guarded by a predicate, and a predicate that is wrong is wrong for every campaign at
 * once.
 *
 * <p>What it costs to get wrong is not symmetrical. A filter that returns too few
 * campaigns is a complaint. A filter that returns one too many publishes somebody's
 * unpublished draft, the length of the moderation queue, a rejection, or — worst — a
 * campaign that trust and safety suspended while an investigation is open.
 *
 * <p>So the assertion is not "the status filter works". It is that no combination of
 * filter and sort this API accepts can produce a campaign in one of the seven hidden
 * states of §6.1 — checked against a fixture holding one campaign in every one of the
 * sixteen, under every status filter, every completion band, and every implemented
 * sort.
