/**
 * {@code GET /v1/discover/facets}: D-10's live faceted counts.
 *
 * <p>The property this suite exists for is the one that decides whether the filter
 * panel is usable at all — <strong>a facet excludes its own dimension and applies
 * every other</strong>. Count the category facet under the category filter the caller
 * already selected and every other category reads zero; the panel then offers exactly
 * one move, which is to clear the filter, and a backer who picked Games can never
 * learn that there are also four campaigns in Comics matching everything else they
 * chose.
 *
 * <p>The second property is the one that makes the numbers trustworthy: a facet's
 * count is exactly the number of cards the feed returns when that value is selected.
 * A panel whose numbers disagree with the results is worse than a panel with no
 * numbers.

     * category counts would produce the same numbers as one that correctly did not.
