/**
 * {@code sort=relevance}: §11.2's composite, term by term.
 *
 * <h2>What this suite is actually asserting</h2>
 *
 * <p>A ranking is a sum, and a sum is the one shape in which every part can be wrong
 * while the whole looks plausible. A test that seeded four campaigns and asserted an
 * order under the default weights would pass with the completion term inverted, with the
 * editorial term reading the wrong view, or with three of the four terms silently
 * dropped — because some order always comes back and every order looks like a ranking.
 *
 * <p>So <strong>every term is tested in isolation, with the other weights at
 * zero</strong>. Each test says "this term, alone, orders these campaigns this way, and
 * this is the direction the term claims". What the terms do together is then a property
 * of arithmetic rather than of this code.
 *
 * <p>The other half is the negative space, and it is the half §11.2's last sentence is
 * about: a weight of zero removes a term's influence entirely, an inactive term
 * contributes exactly nothing, and five of §11.2's eight terms are inert and are
 * <em>visibly</em> so rather than quietly missing. The last of those is asserted in
 * {@code RankingApiTests}, against the diagnostic, because that is where somebody tuning
 * would find out.
 *
 * <h2>The fixture</h2>
 *
 * <p>Deliberately non-collinear: the campaign that wins on completion is not the one
 * that wins on recency, is not the one that wins on the badge, is not the one that wins
 * on text. A fixture in which one campaign led on everything would pass with any three
 * of the four terms broken.
