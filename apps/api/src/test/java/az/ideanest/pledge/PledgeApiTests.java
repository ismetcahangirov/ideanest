/**
 * The checkout over HTTP: drafting a pledge, reading it, confirming it, changing it,
 * and withdrawing it.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@link #aRefusedEditCostsTheBackerNothing()} is the one #56 turns
 * on.</strong> An edit that is refused because the tier the backer wanted has sold
 * out must leave them holding the pledge and the place they already had. That is the
 * whole reason {@code ReservationService#edit} takes the new place before it releases
 * the old one, and the assertion that fails under the opposite — and more natural —
 * ordering, which keeps the stock counts tidier and costs somebody their reward.
 *
 * <p><strong>Three of these carry #52.</strong>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #aReplayedKeyReturnsTheOriginalResponse()} is what #52 is for. It
 *       asserts the two bodies are <em>equal as bytes</em> rather than equivalent as
 *       objects, because "the same response" is the promise and a re-serialisation
 *       that happens to agree today is not it.
 *   <li>{@link #twoIdenticalRequestsAtOnceProduceOnePledge()} is the property no
 *       amount of careful code can give without the database. Two real threads, one
 *       key, one PostgreSQL, and exactly one pledge — the assertion that fails under
 *       every implementation that reads before it writes.
 *   <li>{@link #confirmingMovesTheHeldPlaceToAClaimedOne()} checks both stock columns
 *       either side of one statement, which is the invariant
 *       {@code RewardTierRepository#commitOnePlace} exists to hold.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Money is asserted as the strings the API answers with, never parsed into a
 * double. §10.3 makes the amount a string precisely so that a client cannot do
 * otherwise, and a test that parsed it would be checking a value the contract does
 * not promise.
 *
 * <p>Time is the injected {@link AdjustableClock}. A test that waits five minutes for
 * a reservation, or a day for §17.2's retention, is a test nobody runs.
