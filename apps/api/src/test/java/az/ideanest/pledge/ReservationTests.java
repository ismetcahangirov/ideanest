/**
 * Reservation, under the conditions it exists for.
 *
 * <p><strong>The test that carries the issue is
 * {@link #exactlyTheRemainingPlacesAreSold()}.</strong> Every other property of
 * reservation could be checked by calling a method and reading what it returned;
 * that one cannot, because the failure it is about only happens when two checkouts
 * read "one place left" at the same moment. So it runs real threads, through the
 * real service, against the real PostgreSQL container, and asserts that the number
 * of winners is exactly the number of places — the assertion that would have failed
 * under every implementation that checks and then writes.
 *
 * <p>Three things are asserted about that run, and they fail differently:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the count of successful reservations equals the places available — too many
 *       is an oversold reward, too few is a lost sale;
 *   <li>{@code claimed_quantity + reserved_quantity} equals the limit exactly, which
 *       is what V7's constraint bounds and what a backer's page reads;
 *   <li>the number of DRAFT pledges holding the tier equals
 *       {@code reserved_quantity}. The constraint cannot catch this one: a
 *       reservation that forgot to increment would satisfy every check in the
 *       database and would sell the same place twice.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>{@link #exactlyTheRemainingAddonPlacesAreSold()} is the same test for
 * #203's half of the problem.</strong> An add-on is a {@code reward_tiers} row with
 * {@code is_addon} set, so it has the same counters and the same constraint — and
 * until #203 nothing ever wrote them, so the constraint could not catch anything and
 * sixteen backers could each take the last of nine. It differs from the reward-tier
 * race in the one way that made it a separate piece of work: each backer asks for
 * <em>three</em> places rather than one, so what is serialised is
 * {@code reserved + n <= limit} and the answer is three winners rather than nine.
 *
 * <p>Time is the injected {@link AdjustableClock} rather than a sleep. A test that
 * waits five minutes for a TTL is a test nobody runs, and a test that shortens the
 * TTL to a second asserts a rule against a configuration nothing runs on.
