/**
 * The two decisions this projection makes: which pledges a campaign counts, and what a
 * published backer may be.
 *
 * <p>No database and no Spring. Both are decisions rather than queries — the first is a
 * set, the second is a factory over a plain entity — and a suite that started a
 * PostgreSQL container to assert on them would make the whole build slower for no
 * coverage. The counting rule as the endpoint actually serves it is
 * {@code PublicBackerApiTests}.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@link PublicBacker} has no production consumer today</strong> — §4.4
 * publishes backer data only in aggregate and whether a campaign should list
 * individuals is #209, which is undecided. It is tested anyway, and for the reason its
 * own class comment gives: the guarantee has to exist before the author who would
 * otherwise have to reinvent it, and a type kept without tests is a type that has
 * quietly stopped working by the time somebody needs it.
