/**
 * §4.7's CD-10, CD-07, CD-08 and CD-11 over HTTP: the campaign team's view of who backed
 * it, the two splits behind its charts, and the file it exports.
 *
 * <h2>What these tests are actually pinning</h2>
 *
 * <p>Not "the endpoint answers 200". Four things that are decisions rather than
 * implementation, and that would each be wrong in a way nobody notices:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Which pledges are backers.</strong> A reservation is not a backer and a
 *       cancelled pledge is no longer one. Both would inflate a fulfilment list, and the
 *       second would post a reward to somebody who withdrew.
 *   <li><strong>An anonymous backer is named to their own creator.</strong> PL-12 is a
 *       promise about the public page; withholding the name here would make the reward
 *       undeliverable. {@code PublicBackerApiTests} pins the other half — that the public
 *       count includes them and the public page does not name them.
 *   <li><strong>Paging cannot drop a backer.</strong> The cursor is a pair, and a campaign
 *       whose pledges landed in the same microsecond is exactly the case a
 *       timestamp-only cursor loses rows on.
 *   <li><strong>The export says when it is short.</strong> A truncated fulfilment list
 *       looks exactly like a complete one.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Who may read it at all is {@code CapabilityContractApiTests}', where every capability
 * is asserted twice against a collaborator who holds it and one who does not.
