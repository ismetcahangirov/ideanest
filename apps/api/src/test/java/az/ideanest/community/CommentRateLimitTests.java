/**
 * §17.3's shape applied to the comment box, at the boundary.
 *
 * <p><strong>Not an integration test, and deliberately not one</strong>, for
 * {@code SearchRateLimitTests}' and {@code ReportRateLimitTests}' reason: the suite
 * shares a single Spring context and therefore a single limiter, and every request in
 * it comes from {@code 127.0.0.1} — so a per-address budget small enough to exhaust in
 * a test is a budget {@code CommentApiTests} would exhaust for it. Driving the
 * controller directly keeps the assertion exact: ten comments are accepted, the
 * eleventh is not, and it is not the ninth.
 *
 * <p>The numbers are not the point. Three claims {@code CommentController} makes in
 * prose are, and none of them was previously executed anywhere:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Both budgets are spent.</strong> A per-account limit alone does not
 *       bound somebody with fifty accounts, and a per-address limit alone would refuse
 *       a whole office because one person behind its NAT is arguing on a campaign page.
 *   <li><strong>One budget across both writes.</strong> Posting and replying share it,
 *       so an author who has spent their allowance on top-level comments cannot spend a
 *       second one on replies — which would be the same flood one level down.
 *   <li><strong>Deleting is not counted.</strong> §17.3's control exists to stop a
 *       spam flood; a creator clearing one must not be stopped part way through by it.
 * </ul>
