/**
 * The profile editor — §4.2's P-01 to P-03 (#276), over HTTP.
 *
 * <p><strong>What this suite is really about is that the write exists at all.</strong>
 * {@code users.name}, {@code bio} and {@code avatar_url} were columns for forty-five
 * migrations with no endpoint that wrote one, which is the absence §4.2's block quote names
 * as the reason the account navigation has no profile entry. Half of what is asserted here is
 * therefore ordinary — a field goes in, the same field comes out — and the other half is the
 * part a write path gets wrong.
 *
 * <p>That other half is three properties, and each has its own test rather than a line inside
 * a longer one:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>PATCH means merge, not replace.</strong>
 *       {@link #anAbsentKeyIsUntouchedAndAnExplicitNullClears()} is the whole of RFC 7396 in
 *       one method, and it asserts both directions in one request — a body that mentions one
 *       field and nulls another has to leave a third alone. Read the other way round, a
 *       regression here deletes somebody's biography when they change their name.</li>
 *   <li><strong>A refusal is a refusal, not a silent normalisation.</strong> A non-https URL
 *       and an unknown location slug both answer 400 naming the field, because an endpoint
 *       that dropped either would report success for a save that did not happen — and the
 *       person would find out by looking at their own page days later.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Erasure takes everything.</strong>
 *       {@link #anonymisationTakesTheWholeProfileIncludingTheLinks()} is §17.4 and it is the
 *       test this feature could most plausibly have shipped without: a GDPR erasure that
 *       leaves somebody's Instagram address behind has not erased them, and the links are rows
 *       in a table the {@code users} entity does not map, so nothing about clearing the
 *       columns makes them go.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Bodies are written as JSON strings rather than as maps, and that is not a style
 * preference: {@code Map.of} cannot hold a null, and the difference between a key that is
 * absent and a key that is present and null is exactly what half of these tests are about.
