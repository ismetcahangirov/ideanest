/**
 * The public profile and the switch that withdraws it — §4.2's P-01 and P-07, over HTTP.
 *
 * <p><strong>The substance of this endpoint is what it refuses</strong>, and four of these
 * pin it. A slug nobody holds, an account §17.4 has anonymised, and an account whose owner
 * chose {@code PRIVATE} must be indistinguishable from one another — same status, same
 * body, same code — because any difference between them is an oracle a stranger can ask by
 * guessing a name. {@link #aPrivateProfileAnswersExactlyAsAnAbsentOneDoes()} asserts the
 * bodies against each other rather than against a literal, which is the only form of that
 * assertion that cannot pass while the two drift.
 *
 * <p>{@link #theProfileCarriesNothingThatBelongsToItsOwner()} is the other half: this is a
 * second projection of {@code users}, and the reason it exists rather than reusing
 * {@code MeResponse} is that the row holds an address, a verification flag and a deletion
 * date. The test names the keys exhaustively, so a field added to the projection fails here
 * rather than appearing on a public page.
 *
 * <p>Every read is made without a bearer token, because that is what a visitor has. A suite
 * that authenticated would be testing a different endpoint from the one the security
 * matcher opens.
