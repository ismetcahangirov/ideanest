/**
 * §4.11's role model over HTTP — #295.
 *
 * <h2>{@code GET /v1/admin/me} is the endpoint the whole console hangs off</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every other route under {@code /v1/admin} refuses a caller who is not staff. That
 * was enough while the console had one answer to give — a screen either worked or showed
 * a 403 — and stops being enough the moment capabilities are different per person: the
 * front door has to know which of sixteen modules to offer <em>before</em> the reader
 * clicks one, and discovering it by opening all sixteen and counting the refusals is
 * sixteen audited requests to find out what a console already knows.
 *
 * <p><strong>It is the one route here that requires no capability</strong>, only a valid
 * token. A signed-in visitor who opens {@code /admin} out of curiosity gets
 * {@code staff: false} and a page that says so — where a 403 would be an error in the log
 * for something that is not an error, and would leave the console unable to tell "you do
 * not work here" from "the service is down".
 *
 * <h2>The route is still not a gate, and #295 does not make it one</h2>
 *
 * <p>The epic asks that no admin route be reachable without a staff check performed on
 * the server, and it already is not: the service refuses every read behind every screen.
 * What this endpoint adds is that the browser can now render an honest console instead of
 * a grid of refusals.
 *
 * <p>It deliberately does not become a check in {@code app/admin/layout.tsx}. The web
 * client holds its access token in a module variable and its refresh token in a
 * {@code SameSite=Strict} {@code HttpOnly} cookie that rotates on every use — so a Server
 * Component could only authenticate by spending that cookie, which would invalidate the
 * token the browser is holding and end the session it was trying to check. A layout gate
 * would therefore be a second, weaker copy of a check the service already makes
 * correctly, and the dangerous direction is the one where the browser says yes.
 * {@code AdminArea} carries the same argument.
 *
 * <h2>Everything below {@code /me} needs {@code ADMINISTER_STAFF}</h2>
 *
 * <p>Checked in the service and not by an annotation here, following
 * {@code AuditTrailController}: an annotation on a controller is one somebody forgets on
 * the fifth endpoint, and the service is also where the grant is recorded — an authorised
 * action nobody recorded and a recorded action nobody authorised are the same defect from
 * opposite ends.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code no-store} on all of them.</strong> These responses say who may move
 * money on this platform; a shared cache or a browser's disk cache holding one is a
 * disclosure that survives signing out.
