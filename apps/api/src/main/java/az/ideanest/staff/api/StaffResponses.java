     * when they ask why a screen is missing, and what an administrator changes.
     *
     * <p>Sorted, so that two calls produce the same bytes and a caller diffing them sees
     * a real change. A {@code Set} would serialise in whatever order the enum iteration
     * happened to take.

     * @param accountId whoever the access token names. Echoed so a console holding a
     *     stale token can tell that the answer is not about the person it thinks
     * @param staff whether this account works here at all. Redundant with an empty
     *     capability list and present anyway: it is the one field the console branches on
     *     first, and a client that had to know "empty means no" is a client that will
     *     eventually treat a failed parse as staff
     * @param bootstrapped staff by configuration rather than by a grant. The console
     *     shows this as a warning — an administrator who exists only in an environment
     *     variable cannot be withdrawn through the platform
