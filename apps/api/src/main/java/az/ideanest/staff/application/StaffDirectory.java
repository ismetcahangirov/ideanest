/**
 * Who works here and what they may do — the role model #295 asked for.
 *
 * <p><strong>This replaces {@code project.application.ModeratorDirectory}, and the move
 * between modules is half the point.</strong> {@link PlatformStaff}'s own comment
 * predicted it: "epic #100 replaces what is behind this interface and changes nothing in
 * front of it — which is the reason the callers ask through an interface in
 * {@code shared} rather than naming the directory". That prediction held exactly. Four
 * call sites across three modules named the old class and all four now name the
 * interface, and no caller changed shape.
 *
 * <p>Staff identity left the project module because it was never a fact about campaigns.
 * A member of finance who may issue a refund and may not touch a submission queue has
 * nothing to do with {@code projects}, and a table of staff roles living in the module
 * that owns campaigns would make every future capability a change to the project module.
 *
 * <h2>Two sources, and the second one is a bootstrap rather than a fallback</h2>
 *
 * A grant in V48 is the real answer. {@link StaffProperties#bootstrapEmails()} is the
 * other, and it confers {@link StaffRole#ADMINISTRATOR} — not because a configured
 * address is trusted more, but because granting a role requires
 * {@link StaffCapability#ADMINISTER_STAFF}, so a database with no grants has no way to
 * make its first one. That property's comment has the argument.
 *
 * <p>It is a bootstrap and not a fallback because it does not wait for the table to be
 * empty. An address in the list is an administrator whether or not anybody holds a
 * grant; a rule that only applied when the table was empty would silently withdraw the
 * operator's own access on the day they granted somebody else a role, which is the worst
 * possible moment for it.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing is cached</h2>
 *
 * {@link #capabilitiesOf} queries on every call. A role withdrawn has to stop working on
 * the next request rather than on the next restart — a cache here would mean that
 * removing somebody's access is an action with no defined completion time, which is not
 * something anybody wants to explain after an incident. The query is a primary-key
 * lookup returning at most four rows.
 *
 * <h2>A deleted account is not staff</h2>
 *
 * {@code UserAccounts.findById} excludes soft-deleted rows, and the address lookup goes
 * through it — so an access token minted before the account was closed stops being
 * enough here as soon as it is. The grant rows go with the account through V48's
 * {@code ON DELETE CASCADE}.
