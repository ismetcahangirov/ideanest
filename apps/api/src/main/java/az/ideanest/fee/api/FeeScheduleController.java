/**
 * §4.11's AD-11 over HTTP — #311.
 *
 * <h2>There is no PUT and no PATCH, and that is the design</h2>
 *
 * <p>A rate is a term, not a setting. Editing one in place would silently rewrite what
 * every past payout should have been — V49's header has the argument at length — so the
 * only write is {@code POST /v1/admin/fees}, which closes the schedule in force and opens
 * a new one beginning now.
 *
 * <p>That makes the endpoint look like a create where an operator expects an update, and
 * the screen says so in as many words. The alternative reads more naturally and is the
 * one that makes §22.1's question unanswerable.
 *
 * <h2>Needs {@code CONFIGURE_PLATFORM}, checked in the service</h2>
 *
 * <p>Which only {@code ADMINISTRATOR} holds. Not an annotation here, following
 * {@code AuditTrailController}: the service is also where the change is recorded, and an
 * authorised action nobody recorded and a recorded action nobody authorised are the same
 * defect from opposite ends.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code no-store}</strong>, like every response under this prefix.

     * @param note why the rate changed. Required, unlike a staff grant's note: this one is
     *     read by an auditor rather than by a colleague, and a fee change nobody explained
     *     is one nobody can defend
