/**
 * §22.3's "clear fee disclosure", derived from {@code fee_schedules} — issue #439.
 *
 * <h2>The requirement this closes, and why it was the one still open</h2>
 *
 * <p>§22.3 lists six product requirements. Five were built. The sixth — fee disclosure — was a
 * sentence in a message catalogue saying that the platform charges nothing, which is <em>true
 * today</em> because no schedule is seeded and <strong>becomes false the day one is</strong>. It
 * would become false silently, because nothing checks a catalogue against a table.
 *
 * <p>So the disclosure is derived. A number a creator can check against the payout they get is a
 * disclosure; a sentence about the platform's intentions is not.
 *
 * <h2>Two fees, kept distinguishable</h2>
 *
 * <p>§5.2's platform fee and the payment provider's fee are separate numbers on this response and
 * are never summed for the reader here. #439 says why: "a creator reading '5%' and receiving 94.2%
 * will ask, and the answer needs to already be on the page." A single {@code totalRate} would be
 * the version of this response that produces that question.
 *
 * <h2>Public, cacheable, and honest about having nothing to say</h2>
 *
 * <p>The audience is a backer deciding whether to pledge and a creator deciding whether to launch,
 * neither of whom has necessarily signed in. Nothing in the answer belongs to a person and a
 * schedule changes a handful of times a year, which is the shape a shared cache is correct for.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code configured: false} rather than zeros when no schedule is in force.</strong>
 * The two are not the same statement: zeros are a commitment to charge nothing, and the absence of
 * a schedule is the platform not having decided. {@code FeeSchedules.priceOf} treats the absence
 * as zero fees because a payout run must not stop over it; a page has the opposite obligation, and
 * a client that read zeros here would print "0% platform fee" on the strength of an empty table.
