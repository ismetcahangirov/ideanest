/**
 * What the platform charges, read and changed — §9 and §4.11's AD-11, issue #311.
 *
 * <h2>Two audiences, and they need different things</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #priceOf} is called by the payout run and is the reason this module exists.
 * {@link #replace} is called by one screen, a handful of times a year. The first must
 * never throw for a reason the operator could have prevented; the second must refuse
 * anything it does not understand. That asymmetry is deliberate and shows up in every
 * decision below.
 *
 * <h2>Resolution is most-specific-wins</h2>
 *
 * <p>A campaign's own schedule beats its category's, which beats the platform's. Three
 * queries rather than one with a {@code CASE} ordering, because two of the three are
 * usually misses against an index and the alternative is a scan that sorts before it
 * filters.
 *
 * <h2>No configured schedule is zero fees, not an exception</h2>
 *
 * <p>The tempting alternative is to refuse: a platform that has not decided what it
 * charges should not be paying anybody out. It is wrong because of when the failure
 * lands. The payout run is a scheduled job over every campaign that closed; an exception
 * there stops the run for all of them, on the day somebody forgot to write a row, and the
 * symptom is that nobody gets paid rather than that one figure is wrong. Zero fees
 * overpays a creator, which is visible on the payout screen before anybody approves it —
 * and every payout above the threshold is approved by two people who see the breakdown.
 * So it fails towards a recoverable mistake.
