 * What a campaign is filed under, asked of the module that knows — issue #311.

 * <p><strong>{@code ProjectSummaries}' shape, for the same reason.</strong> A category
 * exception is one of the three scopes {@code FeeScope} names, so pricing a payout has to
 * know which category the campaign is in — and {@code projects} is the project module's
 * table, which {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} keeps this module out of.
 *
 * <p>The alternative was to make every caller of {@link FeeSchedules#priceOf} pass the
 * category. That is worse in a way that is easy to miss: the payout module does not know a
 * campaign's category either, so it would have to be threaded through from wherever
 * somebody did — and the first caller to pass null would silently switch off every
 * category exception on the platform, with no symptom but a slightly larger payout.
 *
 * <p>So the question is asked here, once, by the module that needs the answer.
