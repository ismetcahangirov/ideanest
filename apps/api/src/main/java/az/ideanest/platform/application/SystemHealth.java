/**
 * What the platform looks like right now — §4.11's AD-16 and §18, issue #316.
 *
 * <p><strong>#316 said this was blocked on #138, the observability work, and it was not
 * quite.</strong> §18 is about metrics, traces and alerting — a system that watches
 * continuously and wakes somebody. This screen is the other thing: a page a member of
 * staff opens when a creator says their update never arrived, to see whether the queue is
 * moving. Every number on it is a {@code COUNT} over a table this service already owns,
 * so it needs no collector, no exporter and no #138.
 *
 * <p>What it deliberately does not do is alert. A dashboard nobody is watching is not
 * monitoring, and pretending otherwise is worse than an honest gap — so the screen says
 * in as many words that #138 is still what pages somebody.
 *
 * @param at when this was measured, so a stale tab cannot be mistaken for a healthy
 *     platform
 * @param queues the work waiting to be done
 * @param jobs the scheduled work, and whatever has stopped
 * @param providers every third party the platform calls, and whether it is answering
 * @param status the worst of the above, so the screen can be read in one glance
