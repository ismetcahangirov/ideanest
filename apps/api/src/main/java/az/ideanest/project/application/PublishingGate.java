/**
 * Whether this campaign may be sent for review, given what its creator has paid for.
 *
 * <h2>Why this class exists rather than four lines inside {@code submit}</h2>
 *
 * <p>Two reasons, and the second is the load-bearing one.
 *
 * <p>It is testable without a state machine. The rules here are arithmetic over an
 * allowance and a count, and a test that had to construct a campaign in
 * {@code CHANGES_REQUESTED} to check that a goal of 10,001 is one manat too large is a test
 * about the wrong thing.
 *
 * <p>And it keeps {@code ProjectTransitionService}'s one guarantee legible. That class
 * exists so that "the edge is checked, the state is written, the history is appended"
 * happens in one place and cannot drift; every rule inlined into it makes that harder to
 * see. The checklist is already a collaborator there for the same reason, and this sits
 * beside it.
 *
 * <h2>The counting is here because the rows are here</h2>
 *
 * <p>The subscription module answers what a plan permits and does not know how many
 * campaigns the account is holding — {@code PublishingAllowance} has the argument. So the
 * allowance crosses the boundary and the comparison happens on this side, against the
 * project module's own query.
 *
 * <h2>Two refusals, because they lead somewhere different</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link SubscriptionRequiredException} means "you have not paid", and the web client
 * answers it by navigating to the pricing page. {@link PlanLimitExceededException} means
 * "you have paid and this does not fit", where the answer may be to withdraw a campaign or
 * lower a goal — so it is rendered in place. Collapsing them into one refusal would send a
 * paying customer to a price list to solve a problem money need not solve.
