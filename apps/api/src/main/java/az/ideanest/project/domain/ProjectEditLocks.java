/**
 * Which fields a campaign in this state may no longer have changed. §5.3.
 *
 * <p><strong>A table, not a chain of conditionals</strong>, for the reason
 * {@link ProjectStateMachine} gives about the edges of §6.1. The rule is read in
 * one screen and asserted against the specification in a plain unit test. Written
 * as {@code if (project.getLaunchedAt() != null)} in the two services that enforce
 * it, the same rule becomes two rules — and the first time one of them is extended
 * and the other is not, a campaign's goal and its reward prices disagree about when
 * a campaign counts as launched.
 *
 * <p><strong>No Spring, no database, and not even an entity.</strong> The answer is
 * a function of one enum value. That is what lets the whole of §5.3's post-launch
 * half be checked without starting PostgreSQL, and it is what lets the campaign
 * module and the reward module ask the same question rather than two similar ones.
 *
 * <h2>What counts as launched</h2>
 *
 * <p><strong>The state, not {@code launched_at}.</strong> The two mostly agree —
 * the timestamp is stamped on the edge into {@link ProjectState#LIVE} and nothing
 * clears it — and the state was chosen for three reasons.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>It is what the client can see. The editor response carries {@code state}
 *       beside {@code lockedFields}, so a creator asking why a field is disabled
 *       has the answer in the same body. {@code launchedAt} is in that body too,
 *       but the state is the thing every other refusal in this module is phrased
 *       in — a 409 already says "a project in SUBMITTED cannot move to LIVE".
 *   <li>It keeps the rule a pure function of an enum, which is what makes the
 *       table below a table and its test a unit test. A rule that reads a
 *       timestamp off an entity needs an entity to be checked.
 *   <li>The database has already written the same list down.
 *       {@code projects_public_states_are_fully_specified} in {@code V6} names
 *       exactly the nine states below and calls them the states "the public has
 *       seen and may have pledged to". Two statements of one rule that can be read
 *       side by side are better than one statement and one derivation.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Where they could disagree is a row repaired by hand — a state moved without
 * its timestamp, or the reverse. The state is the column the audit trail records
 * and the check constraint reads, so it is the one to trust.
 *
 * <h2>What an ended campaign locks</h2>
 *
 * <p><strong>Exactly what a live one locks, and no more.</strong>
 * {@link ProjectState#SUSPENDED}, {@link ProjectState#CANCELED},
 * {@link ProjectState#UNSUCCESSFUL}, {@link ProjectState#SUCCESSFUL} and
 * everything after them are all reached from {@link ProjectState#LIVE}, so they
 * are launched and the table freezes the same five things forever. A cancelled
 * campaign is therefore not editable as though it were a draft: its goal, its
 * deadline, and its prices are the record of what backers were asked for, and
 * nothing about ending a campaign makes that safe to rewrite.
 *
 * <p>It deliberately does not lock <em>more</em>. The fields that stay editable —
 * the title, the summary, the story, the risks section, the cover — are the page a
 * backer reads after the money has moved, and §5.5 obliges a creator to keep them
 * informed of delays and to answer complaints. Freezing the story of a campaign
 * that has just ended would freeze the one place the creator can say so.
 *
 * <p>{@link ProjectState#REJECTED} locks nothing, and is the one terminal state
 * that does not. It never became public and nobody ever pledged to it, so there is
 * no promise to protect; that it is terminal already makes every edit to it inert,
 * which is a better reason to leave it alone than a rule.
 *
 * <p>This type answers the question and does not enforce it.
 * {@code ProjectEditingService} and {@code RewardService} are what refuse a write,
 * because a refusal is an HTTP status and a message written for a creator.
