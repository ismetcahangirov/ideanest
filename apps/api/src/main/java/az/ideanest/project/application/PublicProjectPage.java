/**
 * A campaign as its public page shows it — §4.4, and §10.2's
 * {@code GET /v1/projects/{creatorSlug}/{projectSlug}}.
 *
 * <p><strong>The projection {@code PrelaunchPageResponse} said it would not
 * pre-empt.</strong> That response is a teaser for a campaign that has not launched and
 * says so at length; this is the campaign itself, and it exists now because #119 needs
 * the page's content to be in the first byte of HTML rather than assembled by a browser.
 * A server render cannot fetch what no endpoint serves.
 *
 * <h2>What is here, and what has its own endpoint</h2>
 *
 * <p>This carries the campaign's own row and the two things that are useless without it:
 * who made it, and what it is filed under. Everything else on §4.4's page is already a
 * public endpoint of its own — {@code /rewards/public}, {@code /backers/public},
 * {@code /updates}, {@code /comments} — and folding them in here would produce one
 * response whose cost is decided by the longest comment thread on the platform, cached
 * for as long as the least cacheable part of it.
 *
 * <p><strong>The story is carried, and it is the reason this is not a card.</strong>
 * {@code discovery.domain.ProjectCard} is the same campaign for a grid; a page needs the
 * document the creator wrote, and a page that fetched its own body in a second request is
 * a page whose text is not in the HTML — which is the entire complaint #119 is about.
 *
 * <h2>The outcome</h2>
 *
 * <p>Null while the campaign is running, and V29's four frozen columns once it has
 * closed. It is what lets a closed campaign's page say "raised 12,500 ₼ of 10,000 ₼ from
 * 42 backers" months later, after collections have failed and {@link #pledged()} has
 * moved: #63's rule is that a later collection failure reduces the payout, never the
 * outcome, and a page that reported only the live total would quietly contradict the word
 * "successful" printed next to it.
 *
 * @param state one of §6.1's nine public states. By name, because every consumer of this
 *     projection is outside the module that owns the enum
 * @param goal null on a campaign that has not launched — §5.3 requires one by submission
 *     and {@code PRELAUNCH} precedes it
 * @param pledged never null; {@code projects.pledged_amount} is {@code NOT NULL DEFAULT 0}
 * @param story the creator's document, verbatim, as the JSON it is stored as. Opaque
 *     here: #35 owns its schema, and a projection that parsed it would be a second
 *     implementation of that schema in the read path
 * @param latePledgeEnabled §4.5's PL-16 (#81): whether this creator offers late pledges.
 *     On the public page because a visitor arriving after the deadline needs to know
 *     whether there is still a way to back this, and the campaign's state alone does not
 *     say it -- a campaign can be in LATE_PLEDGE with the switch turned off, which is a
 *     creator who ran out of stock
 * @param latePledgeEndsAt when the window closes, or null when none is open. The date a
 *     backer is counting down to, which is why it is published rather than left as
 *     something the checkout refuses them with
 * @param outcome null until the deadline has been decided
