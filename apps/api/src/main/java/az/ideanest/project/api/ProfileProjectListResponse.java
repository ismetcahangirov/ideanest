/**
 * One page of the campaigns on somebody's profile — §10.2's
 * {@code GET /v1/users/{slug}/projects}.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code nextCursor} is null on the last page rather than absent or
 * empty.</strong> {@code SavedListResponse} gives the reason and it is the platform's
 * convention: a client tests one thing — is there a cursor — and the three-way distinction
 * between null, missing and {@code ""} is exactly what gets handled two ways in two
 * clients.
 *
 * <p><strong>No total.</strong> §4.2 shows a count beside each tab and this response does
 * not carry one, which is a decision rather than an oversight: {@code PublicProfiles}
 * argues it in full, and the short form is that a count over a second predicate is a number
 * that can disagree with the list underneath it, and the profile's backed tab has two
 * reasons — a suspended campaign, an anonymous pledge — for it to.
 *
 * <p><strong>Declared here and reused by the pledge module</strong>, like
 * {@link ProfileProjectCard} itself: the backed tab beside this one serves the identical
 * shape, and two records for one grid is the drift {@code SavedListResponse} and
 * {@code FollowingListResponse} were content to accept because they render different things.
 * These render the same thing.
 *
 * @param projects the cards, newest first
 * @param nextCursor the opaque value to pass back as {@code ?cursor=}, or null at the end
