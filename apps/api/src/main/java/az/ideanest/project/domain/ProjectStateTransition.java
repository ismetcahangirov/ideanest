/**
 * One recorded move in a campaign's life.
 *
 * <p><strong>Append-only.</strong> There is no setter on this class and no
 * repository method that updates or deletes one. The value of an audit trail is
 * entirely in the fact that it cannot be tidied up afterwards: a moderation
 * decision that let a campaign collect money from the public has to remain
 * reviewable by somebody who was not in the room, and a row that can be edited
 * is a row that says whatever the last writer wanted it to say.
 *
 * <p>{@code fromState} is null exactly once per campaign, on creation — there is
 * no state before {@link ProjectState#DRAFT}. Recording creation as a transition
 * rather than inferring it from {@code created_at} means the history reads as a
 * complete sequence without a special case at the front.
 *
 * <p>The actor is an identifier rather than an association, for the reason given
 * on {@link Project}: {@code users} belongs to another module.
