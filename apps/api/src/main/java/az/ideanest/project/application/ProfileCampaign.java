/**
 * A campaign as a card on somebody's profile — §4.2's created and backed tabs.
 *
 * <p><strong>A third projection of {@code projects}, and the reason it is not one of the
 * two that exist is worth stating.</strong> {@link PublicProjectPage} is the campaign page
 * and carries the story document, the risks, the taxonomy and V29's frozen outcome; a grid
 * of twenty of those would fetch twenty story documents to render twenty titles.
 * {@code shared.project.ProjectSummary} is the other, and its own comment forbids exactly
 * this use: it is five fields on purpose, it is a published contract every implementation
 * must produce, and a caller that wanted the goal or the state from it "is asking for a
 * projection rather than a summary". This is that projection.
 *
 * <p><strong>The cover is a nested record rather than {@code project.domain.CoverImage},
 * and that is a module boundary rather than a preference.</strong> This projection is read
 * by the pledge module — {@code GET /v1/users/{slug}/backed} and {@code GET /v1/me/pledges}
 * are its endpoints and both render these cards — and {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} forbids
 * any module from naming another's {@code .domain}. A projection that carried the value
 * object would compile here and fail the boundary test over there, which is the same
 * argument {@code PublicProjects.PublicCampaign} makes about handing out a {@code Project}.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code createdAt} is here and is never serialised.</strong> It is the
 * ordering key {@link ProfileCursor} pages on, so the service needs it to build the cursor
 * for the next page. It does not reach a client: when a campaign was drafted is a fact
 * about a creator's working habits, and {@code launchedAt} is the date a reader means when
 * they ask how old a campaign is.
 *
 * @param state one of §6.1's sixteen, by name. Nine of them on the public lists — see
 *     {@link ProfileCampaigns} — and any of the sixteen on a backer's own pledge list,
 *     which must still name a campaign trust and safety has stopped
 * @param goal null on a {@code PRELAUNCH} campaign, which is the one public state §5.3
 *     lets a campaign reach before it has a goal
 * @param pledged never null; {@code projects.pledged_amount} is {@code NOT NULL DEFAULT 0}
 * @param creatorSlug the campaign's half of a link needs the creator's half beside it —
 *     §10.2's public campaign page is {@code /projects/{creatorSlug}/{projectSlug}} and one
 *     slug alone addresses nothing. Null only when the creator row could not be joined,
 *     which {@link ProfileCampaigns#ofAnyState} explains and the two public reads exclude
 * @param cover null for a campaign with no cover image
