/**
 * Every campaign on the platform, for the people who operate it.
 *
 * <p><strong>The console could not answer "what campaigns are there".</strong> §4.11's
 * sixteen modules gave staff three ways to reach a campaign — a report somebody filed
 * about it, the submission queue #381 added, and a suspension endpoint that takes an id
 * a member of staff had to already have. All three start from a campaign that has done
 * something. A campaign that is simply live, or simply a draft, or that was approved
 * last week and has been sitting unlaunched since, appeared in none of them, and the
 * only way to look one up was psql.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not the submission queue with the filter widened</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link CampaignSubmissionQueue} answers "what is waiting on a moderator": oldest
 * first, keyed on the transition that put each campaign in its state, carrying the note
 * that came with the last decision, and refusing any state that is not one a moderator
 * decides. Widening it would mean an endpoint whose ordering — how long something has
 * waited — is meaningless for the states it had been widened to include, and a queue
 * that stops being a queue is a screen nobody can work from.
 *
 * <p>This is a directory: newest first, every state, with the funding figures a member
 * of staff wants when they are looking at a campaign rather than deciding it.
 *
 * <h2>Who may read it</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code MODERATE_CONTENT}, the check the submission queue makes. This is a wider
 * read than that one — it includes drafts, which are private working documents their
 * creators have shown nobody — so it cannot be a looser check, and there is no capability
 * between "staff at all" and this one that would fit better.

     * <h2>The search, and why the screen had none</h2>
     *
     * <p>#404: this is the only screen that lists campaigns in every state, and it had no
     * input of any kind — sixteen status chips and a "load more" button. Finding one campaign
     * among hundreds meant paging and reading. The account directory next door has had a
     * search box since #104 and shows it is not hard.
     *
     * <p>What a term matches, and the cost of matching it, is
     * {@link az.ideanest.project.infrastructure.CampaignDirectoryRows}'s to explain. What is
     * decided here is that a term reaches the database rather than narrowing a loaded page:
     * twenty-five campaigns of which two match is not a page of two, and a client that
     * dropped rows locally would hold a cursor that has already moved past them. The report
     * queue states the same rule about its own filters.
     *
     * @param staffId whoever is signed in
     * @param state the state to narrow to, or null for every campaign. Every value of the
     *     enum is a legitimate filter here, which is the difference from the queue: this
     *     endpoint is not asking what can be decided, so "no campaigns are LIVE" is a fact
     *     about the platform rather than a misuse of the endpoint, and an empty page says
     *     it perfectly well
     * @param creatorId one person's campaigns, or null for everybody's. What the console's
     *     account detail screen reads — #404 asks that a moderator can see what somebody has
     *     created before deciding whether to suspend them, and until this filter existed the
     *     answer was reachable only through psql
     * @param query a search over the title, the two paths, the creator's name, or an
     *     identifier. Null or blank for no search
     * @param after the last campaign of the previous page, or null for the first
     * @param limit already clamped by the controller, which is where a request's shape is

     *
     * <p>The submission queue asks a moderator to approve, reject or send back a campaign,
     * and its only link to that campaign pointed at the public page. A campaign in review
     * is not public — that is what being in review means — so the link was a 404 by
     * construction, and the decision was taken on a title, a creator's name and a goal
     * figure. Everything the creator actually wrote was one screen away and unreachable.
     *
     * <h2>The same page, not a summary of it</h2>
     *
     * <p>{@link PublicProjectPages#find(UUID, String)} is the projection the public page
     * is served from, and this reads it unchanged. A moderator decides whether a campaign
     * may be published, so what they must be shown is what publishing it would show;
     * anything narrower would be a second description of the campaign, and the decision
     * would be made against the description rather than the thing.

     * <p>{@code MODERATE_CONTENT}, the same capability {@link #page} requires and for the
     * stronger version of its reason. The directory lists drafts; this reads one, and a
     * draft is a private working document its creator has shown nobody. There is no
     * capability between "staff at all" and this one, and the audience for this endpoint
     * is exactly the audience that can already approve or reject the campaign.
