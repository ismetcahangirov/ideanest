/**
 * §4.7's CD-01 on the wire — what {@code GET /v1/projects/{id}/dashboard} answers.
 *
 * <p>Money is a {@link Money}, so §10.3's rule applies without this file restating it: an
 * amount crosses as a string inside {@code {"amount", "currency"}} and never as a JSON
 * number. {@code ProjectAnalyticsResponse} says the same thing about the same reason —
 * a figure that became a double on the way to a progress bar would round somebody's
 * pledge, and this is the screen that number is read off.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@link #percentFunded()} is a JSON number, and that is deliberate rather
 * than an oversight.</strong> {@code ReferrerReportResponse.share} made this call first
 * and the argument is the same: a percentage at two decimal places is not money, nobody
 * charges it, and two places of percent survive a double exactly. What must not become a
 * double is the amount it was computed from, and {@link #raised()} and {@link #goal()}
 * are {@link Money} for that reason. A client that wants exactness recomputes the ratio
 * from those two; this field is for the progress bar.
 *
 * @param serverTime when this was computed. <strong>Returned on purpose, and the
 *     countdown depends on it</strong>: a client subtracts it from its own clock once to
 *     learn the offset, then counts down against the deadline. A precomputed
 *     {@code secondsRemaining} would be wrong the moment it was sent — see
 *     {@link CampaignDashboard}
 * @param goalReached whether the goal has been met, which is deliberately not derivable
 *     from {@link #state()}. A campaign can be at 130% and still {@code LIVE}, and it is
 *     the difference between an interface saying "act now" and one saying "you did it".
 *     CLAUDE.md §2 is emphatic that those are different colours and mean opposite things
 * @param outcome null until the deadline has been decided
