/**
 * The only way a campaign's state changes.
 *
 * <p><strong>Three things happen together or not at all:</strong> the edge is
 * checked against §6.1, the state is written, and a row is appended to
 * {@code project_state_transitions}. One transaction, one method, and no other
 * path — {@link Project} has no state setter, the repository has no update that
 * touches the column, and every endpoint that changes a state calls one of the
 * methods here.
 *
 * <p>That constraint is the whole design. Split across the seven endpoints that
 * perform transitions, the audit row becomes something each of them remembers to
 * write, and the first one that forgets produces a campaign whose history has a
 * hole in it — discovered months later, by somebody trying to establish who
 * approved a campaign that should not have been approved.
 *
 * <p><strong>Completeness is re-checked on submission, by the class the
 * checklist endpoint uses.</strong> {@code ProjectChecklistService} evaluates
 * §5.3 for both, which is why {@code GET /v1/projects/{id}/checklist} and this
 * service cannot disagree about whether a campaign is ready. A second, partial
 * version of those rules written inline here would be the bug that arrangement
 * exists to prevent — and the endpoint is advice to a client that may be old or
 * may not be ours, so this is where "state transitions are enforced server-side
 * and cannot be bypassed" is actually true.
 *
 * <p><strong>Publishing is also gated on a subscription.</strong> {@link PublishingGate}
 * is asked on submission, between the edge check and the checklist, and it refuses a
 * creator who has not paid or whose plan does not stretch to this campaign. It is a
 * collaborator here rather than four inline conditions for the reason the checklist is:
 * this class exists so that the edge, the write and the history stay one legible
 * guarantee, and every rule inlined into it makes that harder to see.
 *
 * <p><strong>What is not here.</strong> Transitions driven by time rather than by
 * a person — a scheduled launch arriving, a deadline passing — are scheduled work
 * (§8.4) and belong to the epics that own them; they will call these same methods
 * with {@link ActorRole#SYSTEM}, which is why the actor is a parameter and not the
 * current user.

     *
     * <p><strong>Two states and not one, and this method is why they are worth
     * having.</strong> §5.1's successful branch says "collect every confirmed pledge",
     * and a platform that decided and charged in one transaction could not tell you,
     * after a crash, which of the two it had done. {@code CampaignFinalizer} writes the
     * decision and stops; this reads it and starts the money moving, and the durable
     * record between them is the state itself.
     *
     * <p>Claimed the way {@link #finalise} claims: the row is locked and the state
     * re-read under the lock, so a second replica arriving mid-pass finds
     * {@code COLLECTING} and does nothing. That matters as much here as it does there —
     * opening a collection twice would queue a campaign's pledges twice, and the second
     * queuing would reset every backer's attempt count to zero and hand them four fresh
     * attempts at a card that had already been refused four times.
     *
     * <p><strong>It does not queue the pledges.</strong> Those are the pledge module's
     * rows and §16.1 forbids reaching for them from here; {@code CampaignCollection}
     * composes the two inside one transaction, which is where the requirement that they
     * commit together is stated.
