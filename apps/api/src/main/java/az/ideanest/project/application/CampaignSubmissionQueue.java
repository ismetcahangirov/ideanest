/**
 * What is waiting on a moderator, and the gap it closes.
 *
 * <p>{@code ProjectModerationController} has served {@code approve}, {@code reject} and
 * {@code request-changes} since #101, and nothing has ever listed what they apply to.
 * The consequence was not theoretical: a moderator could only reach a campaign through
 * a <em>report</em> about it, so a campaign nobody complained about could be submitted
 * and wait indefinitely, invisible to the console, while its creator saw "submitted for
 * review". Three privileged actions whose subject cannot be found are three actions
 * nobody takes.
 *
 * <p><strong>This is not the report queue and does not belong in the moderation
 * module.</strong> A report is a complaint somebody filed; this is a state in a
 * campaign's own state machine, read off {@code projects} and
 * {@code project_state_transitions}, which are this module's tables. The moderation
 * module owning it would mean reaching into them — the same argument
 * {@code ProjectModerationController} already makes about why the three outcomes live
 * here.
 *
 * <h2>The states it serves</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code SUBMITTED} is the queue and is the default. The other three
 * — {@code CHANGES_REQUESTED}, {@code APPROVED}, {@code REJECTED} — are how a moderator
 * looks back at what was decided, which is the same shape the report queue gives its
 * three states and is worth having for the same reason: a decision nobody can find
 * afterwards is a decision that cannot be reviewed. Anything else is refused rather
 * than answered empty, because "no campaigns are LIVE for review" is a sentence that
 * reads as a fact about the platform instead of as a misuse of the endpoint.
 *
 * <h2>Who may read it</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code MODERATE_CONTENT}, through {@link PlatformStaff#requireCapability}. A queue
 * that listed campaigns to anybody signed in would publish, for every unlaunched
 * campaign on the platform, its title, its goal and the fact that its creator is
 * waiting on us — so a check of some kind is not optional.
 *
 * <p><strong>It is a narrower check than the three outcomes it feeds make.</strong>
 * {@code ProjectAccess.requireModeratable} asks only whether the caller is staff at
 * all, so a finance-only account can still approve a campaign over the API while this
 * screen refuses to show it one. That is a pre-existing looseness and this class does
 * not widen it; narrowing the outcomes to match is a change to three endpoints with
 * their own tests, and belongs in its own pull request rather than riding along with a
 * screen.
