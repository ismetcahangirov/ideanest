/**
 * The story document: what a valid one is, and how long its prose is.
 *
 * <p>A pure static type with no Spring and no database in sight, for the same
 * reason {@link ProjectStateMachine} is one — the schema is a table of rules, and
 * a table of rules is worth testing on its own rather than through an HTTP
 * request that also had to authenticate, authorise, and open a transaction.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why the server validates a document the client just built.</strong>
 * The story is the one field of a campaign that is rendered as markup on a public
 * page (§10.4 calls creator story content untrusted by definition). Everything
 * the renderer is willing to draw has to be a shape it recognises, or the
 * renderer becomes the thing that decides what a {@code javascript:} URL means.
 * The client's own copy of these rules exists to give immediate feedback; this
 * one exists because the client is a program on somebody else's computer.
 *
 * <p><strong>Unknown properties are refused, not ignored.</strong> The usual
 * argument for tolerance — forward compatibility — does not apply to a document
 * carried by a versioned envelope: a new block property arrives with
 * {@link #SCHEMA_VERSION} incremented, and until then a property nothing reads is
 * a place to hide a payload that some later renderer might. The document is
 * stored verbatim, so anything accepted here is accepted forever.
 *
 * <p>The block union is exactly the epic contract §5 and
 * {@code docs/architecture.md} §4.6: headings, paragraphs, lists, quotes, rules,
 * inline images, and third-party embeds. No block is added here without the
 * public project page being taught to render it, because a document containing
 * one would validate and then display as nothing.
