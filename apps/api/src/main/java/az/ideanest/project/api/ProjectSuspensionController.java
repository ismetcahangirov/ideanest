/**

 *
 * <p><strong>Its own controller rather than a fourth method on
 * {@link ProjectModerationController}</strong>, because §10.2 puts it under a different
 * resource and the difference is real: the three moderation outcomes decide a campaign
 * that is <em>waiting</em> to be published, and this stops one that is already taking
 * money. They share the staff check and nothing else — different edge, different
 * consequences, different audit action.
 *
 * <p><strong>Staff only</strong>, through the same configured list, which
 * {@code ProjectModerationController} argues at length. Until epic #100 gives the
 * platform a role model, two lists that can disagree about who is staff would be worse
 * than one dependency that epic deletes.
 *
 * <p>{@code POST} rather than {@code DELETE}: nothing is removed. The campaign keeps its
 * page, its history and its pledges — which are cancelled rather than charged — and what
 * is created is the suspension.
