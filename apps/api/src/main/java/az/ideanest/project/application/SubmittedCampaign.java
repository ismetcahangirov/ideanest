/**
 * One campaign waiting on a moderator, as the queue screen needs it.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately not the campaign. A moderator working a queue is deciding which row
 * to open, not reading the story — so this carries what that decision is made on and
 * nothing else, and everything further is one navigation away on the campaign's own
 * page. The alternative, returning the full project, would put a story document and a
 * risks section into every row of a page of twenty-five.
 *
 * @param cursor the keyset position of this row, and the value a client passes as
 *     {@code after} to get the next page. The identifier of the transition that put
 *     the campaign in this state — see {@code SubmissionQueueRow} for why it is not
 *     the campaign's own
 * @param waitingSince when the campaign entered this state. The number the queue is
 *     really about: a campaign is not late because of anything it contains
 * @param note whatever was written on that transition, or null
 * @param creatorName the display name, resolved through {@code UserAccounts}. Null
 *     when the account has been deleted since — §17.4 anonymises rather than removes
 *     the campaign, so the row survives its author and says so rather than throwing
 * @param goal null only for a campaign that reached a decision before §5.3 required
 *     one; nothing in {@code SUBMITTED} can have a null goal
