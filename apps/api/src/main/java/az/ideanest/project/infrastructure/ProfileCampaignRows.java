/**
 * The cards on a profile page, in one query each.
 *
 * <p><strong>SQL rather than JPA, for {@code PublicProjectPages}' reason.</strong> A card
 * needs the campaign and the creator's slug, {@code users} belongs to another module —
 * there is no association to map and mapping one would be this module reaching into that
 * one's domain — and {@code ProjectRepository} maps an entity with fifty columns, a story
 * document and a frozen outcome. Rendering twenty titles through it would pull twenty
 * story documents through Hibernate.
 *
 * <p>A read model, deliberately: nothing here returns a
 * {@link az.ideanest.project.domain.Project}. These rows are served to anybody, so what
 * they may show is a decision — {@code ProfileCampaigns} owns it — and handing an entity to
 * the API layer would make every column on {@code projects} one edit away from being
 * public.
 *
 * <h2>Two page queries rather than one with a nullable cursor</h2>
 *
 * <p>The first page and the pages after it are separate statements. The alternative —
 * {@code (:cursorAt IS NULL OR (created_at, id) < (:cursorAt, :cursorId))} — reads as one
 * rule and is two: PostgreSQL cannot infer the type of a bound {@code NULL} in that
 * position, so every occurrence needs a cast, and the planner is handed a predicate it
 * cannot use for a range scan on the page where it matters least. Two statements are two
 * plans, both of which are the plan they should be.
 *
 * <p>The comparison itself is a row value, {@code (p.created_at, p.id) < (:at, :id)}, which
 * is the one form that expresses "strictly after this row in this ordering" without
 * spelling out the tie-break as a second disjunct — and a hand-written disjunct is how a
 * keyset page comes to drop the row on the boundary.
 *
 * <h2>The join, and where it is outer</h2>
 *
 * <p>Both public reads join {@code users} inner and require {@code deleted_at IS NULL}, as
 * {@code PublicProjectPages} does and for its reason: a campaign whose creator has been
 * anonymised has no creator to name and no addressable public page, and a card with a blank
 * byline is worse than a card that is not served.
 *
 * <p>{@link #ofAnyState} joins outer instead, and that is the whole difference between it
 * and {@link #publiclyVisible}. It serves a backer their own pledges, where dropping the
 * campaign would leave a pledge attached to nothing — {@code ProjectSummaryLookup} makes
 * exactly this argument about the {@code LEFT JOIN} in its own query.
