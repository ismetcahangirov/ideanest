/**
 * Who may do what to a campaign. The only place that question is answered.
 *
 * <p><strong>Two kinds of holder, and they are not the same kind.</strong> The
 * creator's authority comes from {@code projects.creator_id} and is implicit:
 * there is no {@code collaborators} row for them, because a row could be revoked
 * or edited, and either would be a way to lock somebody out of their own
 * campaign. Everybody else holds a set of {@link Capability} values granted by
 * somebody who held them first. {@link Grants} is that distinction as a value,
 * and it is what makes "only the creator may grant
 * {@link Capability#MANAGE_COLLABORATORS}" expressible at all.
 *
 * <p><strong>Loading and checking are one call.</strong> Every method here
 * returns the campaign, so there is no way to obtain one without having been
 * authorised for it. Had this class only answered {@code boolean canEdit(...)},
 * the load would have lived in the services and a new service method could have
 * loaded a campaign and forgotten to ask.
 *
 * <p><strong>Coarse and fine forms, deliberately both.</strong> The two-argument
 * methods answer "may this account administer this campaign at all" and are what
 * a caller uses when the request is not about one specific capability — reading
 * the editor projection, or an action that belongs to the creator alone. The
 * three-argument forms name the capability the request needs, and a caller that
 * knows which one it needs is expected to say so: a collaborator with
 * {@code EDIT_STORY} is not a collaborator with {@code EDIT_REWARDS}, and a
 * single coarse check would make those two grants the same grant.
 *
 * <p><strong>404 for a stranger, 403 for a collaborator.</strong> A caller with
 * no relationship to the campaign is told it does not exist — see
 * {@link ProjectNotFoundException} for why that is not evasiveness. A caller who
 * holds an active grant and is missing the capability this request needs gets
 * {@link CapabilityNotGrantedException} and a 403: they were invited, they can
 * already see the campaign, and there is nothing left to hide from them. A
 * <em>revoked</em> collaborator is a stranger again, and gets the 404 — the
 * confidentiality that 404 protects is exactly what a revocation withdraws.
 *
 * <p><strong>Other modules ask through {@link ProjectAuthorisation}.</strong> They may
 * not name {@link Capability}, which is this module's domain enum, so the vocabulary is
 * published as {@link ProjectCapability} and this class is the implementation that
 * turns one into the other. Before that contract existed, every out-of-module caller
 * could only ask the coarse "may this account edit this campaign at all", and four of
 * them did — which is how a collaborator granted only {@link Capability#EDIT_REWARDS}
 * came to be able to publish a project update and read the referral report. The
 * mapping is {@link Capability#of(ProjectCapability)} and it is total; nothing else in
 * the service needs to know there are two enums.

     * exercise it. A collaborator granted only {@code VIEW_FINANCES} or
     * {@code RESPOND_TO_COMMENTS} is not an editor and is refused.
     *
     * <p><strong>This is the check for opening the editor, not for writing to
     * it.</strong> {@code PATCH /v1/projects/{id}} carries basics, the story, and
     * the risks section in one body, so accepting any editing capability on the
     * write path would make the grants indistinguishable in practice — a
