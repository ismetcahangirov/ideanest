/**
 * The public campaign page, in one query.
 *
 * <p><strong>SQL rather than JPA, and the reason is the joins.</strong> The page needs
 * the campaign, its creator, and the localised name of what it is filed under.
 * {@code users} belongs to another module — there is no association to map and mapping
 * one would be this module reaching into that one's domain — and the taxonomy names live
 * in a translation table with a per-locale row. Through JPA that is either four
 * repositories and four round trips or an association this module may not have; as one
 * statement it is one indexed lookup and one row. {@code discovery.infrastructure} makes
 * the same choice about the same two tables, and {@code ProjectCardRows} is where it says
 * so.
 *
 * <p>A read model, deliberately: nothing here returns a {@link az.ideanest.project.domain.Project}.
 * The page is served to anybody, so what it may show is a decision — {@code PublicProjects}
 * owns it — and handing an entity to the API layer would make every column on
 * {@code projects} one edit away from being public.
 *
 * <h2>The locale fallback is stated twice, on purpose</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code COALESCE(requested, az, slug)} below is the same chain {@code Taxonomy} walks
 * in Java, and the duplication is the arrangement rather than an oversight: one statement
 * and one derivation that cannot disagree because nothing reads it is worse than two
 * statements checked against each other, which is what {@code PublicProjectApiTests}
 * does. Doing it in SQL is what keeps the page one query; doing it in Java is what keeps
 * the category tree one document.

     * taxon need not have a row in the requested language — the second is the case that
     * would otherwise render an empty breadcrumb, and an inner join would drop the whole
     * campaign over a missing translation.
     *
     * <p><strong>Two callers address the same row two different ways</strong>, which is
     * why the predicate is separate from the projection rather than the query being
     * written twice. The public page is addressed by the pair of slugs its URL carries;

     * is opened from holds identifiers and a campaign in review has no public URL. A
