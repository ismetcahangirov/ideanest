/**
 * A campaign as its public page, on the wire — §10.2's
 * {@code GET /v1/projects/{creatorSlug}/{projectSlug}}.
 *
 * <p>Every amount is §10.3's {@code {"amount", "currency"}} object with a string amount,
 * because {@link Money} carries its own serialiser and there is therefore no call site
 * here that could produce a JSON number. On a page whose whole subject is how much money
 * a campaign has raised, that is not a formality.
 *
 * <p>Nulls are omitted, as on {@link PrelaunchPageResponse} and for its reason: this
 * response feeds a page rather than a form, so "absent" and "empty" mean the same thing
 * to its reader. It matters most for {@code outcome}, which is absent on every campaign
 * that is still running — a client that has to distinguish "not decided" from "decided
 * badly" does so by the key being there.
 *
 * @param state one of §6.1's nine public states, by name. A client renders a countdown, a
 *     "funded" badge or an archive notice from this and from nothing else
 * @param goal null on a pre-launch page, which is the one public state a campaign reaches
 *     before §5.3 requires one
 * @param pledged what the campaign has raised <em>now</em>. On a closed campaign this
 *     keeps moving as collections fail; {@code outcome} is what does not
 * @param story the creator's document as JSON, not as a string containing JSON — see
 *     {@link #of}
 * @param outcome §5.1's decision and the numbers that produced it, once the deadline has
 *     passed. Absent while the campaign is running
