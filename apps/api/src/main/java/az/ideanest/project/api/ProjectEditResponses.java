/**
 * The one place a campaign becomes a {@link ProjectEdit}.
 *
 * <p>Nine endpoints across two controllers return this response. Mapped in one
 * place so that a field added to the projection appears in all nine, rather than
 * in the ones somebody remembered — the failure that makes a client's state depend
 * on which request it happened to make last.
 *
 * <p>It is also where {@code lockedFields} is filled in: one method, one list, and
 * no endpoint to revisit. Every response that changes a campaign therefore carries
 * the current answer, including the one to the request that launched it — which is
 * the moment a client most needs to be told that the goal has just frozen.
