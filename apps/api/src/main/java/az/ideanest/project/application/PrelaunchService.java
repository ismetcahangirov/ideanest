/**
 * The pre-launch page, and the people who asked to be told when it opens.
 *
 * <p><strong>Nothing here is behind {@link ProjectAccess}, and that is the
 * point.</strong> Every other service in this module starts by asking who the
 * caller is; these three methods are read and written by the public, most of whom
 * have no account. What stands in for authorisation is the campaign's state:
 * {@link RemindersClosedException#ACCEPTED_IN} is the whole access rule, and it is
 * checked on the read as well as on the write so that a draft cannot be inspected
 * by anybody who guesses an identifier.
 *
 * <p><strong>Two kinds of follower, one row each.</strong> §17.4 decided the
 * shape. An account is stored as a reference, so anonymisation reaches it without
 * this table being swept; somebody with no account is stored as an address,
 * because there is nowhere else it could go. The reasoning, and the alternative
 * that was rejected, are in the header of {@code V10}. The consequence here is
 * {@link #register}: a signed-in caller's reminder is their account's, and the
 * address in the body — if a client sends one — is ignored rather than trusted,
 * because the account's address is the one registration verified and an address
 * taken from the request is one the caller chose.
 *
 * <p><strong>Consent is the row.</strong> There is no separate consent record and
 * there does not need to be one: the row exists because somebody asked for exactly
 * one message, {@code created_at} is when they asked, and it is deleted the moment
 * they say otherwise — see {@link #withdraw}, and the note in {@code V10} on why
 * withdrawal is a delete rather than §7.3's soft delete. What is <em>not</em>
 * settled is how long a row that has already been notified may be kept. That is a
 * retention question with a legal answer (§22.1, "Personal data"), and until it
 * has one the rows stay rather than being purged to a guessed period — stated here
 * rather than quietly implemented one way or the other.
