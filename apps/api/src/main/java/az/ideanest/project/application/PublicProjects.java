/**
 * Whether a campaign may be read by somebody with no relationship to it, for a
 * caller that may not name a campaign.
 *
 * <p><strong>The counterpart of {@link ProjectAccess}, not a variant of it.</strong>
 * That class answers "who may act on this campaign" and every one of its methods
 * takes an account. The public surfaces have no account to take — a visitor reading
 * a campaign page is the audience they exist for — and what stands in for
 * authorisation is the campaign's state, exactly as {@link PrelaunchService} says of
 * its own three methods. Keeping that second rule in one place is the same argument
 * that gave the first one a home: written inline in each public endpoint, it becomes
 * one rule per endpoint, and the first one that forgets {@code SUSPENDED} publishes a
 * campaign trust and safety stopped.
 *
 * <p><strong>The nine states, and why they are these nine.</strong> They are exactly
 * {@code DiscoveryStatus.PUBLIC_STATES}, which is the set every read in the discovery
 * module already applies. Two of the sixteen decide the shape:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link ProjectState#PRELAUNCH} is in. It has a public page — that is what the
 *       {@code DRAFT → PRELAUNCH} edge is for — so a stranger holding its identifier
 *       is looking at something the creator published.
 *   <li>{@link ProjectState#SUSPENDED} is out, although it is a campaign the public
 *       has already seen and pledged to. It was stopped by trust and safety,
 *       frequently while an investigation is open, and continuing to serve its
 *       reward tiers would be offering for sale what the platform has just withdrawn.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The set is written here rather than imported from discovery because that one
 * lives in {@code discovery.domain}, which is another module's internals —
 * {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} forbids reaching into it, and rightly: discovery reads
 * {@code projects.state} as text out of its own SQL and has no {@link ProjectState}
 * to say it with. Two independent statements of one rule, checked against each other
 * in a test, is the arrangement {@code DiscoveryStatus} already uses for its own
 * partition, and it is better than one statement and one derivation that cannot
 * disagree because nobody ever reads it.
 *
 * <p><strong>404, never 403.</strong> A campaign that is not publicly visible is
 * answered as one that does not exist, which is the answer {@link ProjectAccess}
 * gives a stranger and the answer {@link PrelaunchService#page} gives for a draft. A
 * 403 would confirm the identifier is real, and what it would confirm about is a
 * campaign somebody is still preparing or one a moderator has just stopped.
