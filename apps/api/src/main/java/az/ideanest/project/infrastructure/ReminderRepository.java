/**
 * Launch reminders, by the five questions actually asked of them.
 *
 * <p><strong>There is no {@code save}-shaped registration.</strong> Registering is
 * {@link #insertIfAbsent}, a native {@code INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING},
 * because idempotency is the whole feature and a read-then-write check in Java
 * loses the race between two clicks: both would see no row, both would insert,
 * and the campaign would owe that person two emails. The unique indexes in
 * {@code V10} are the check, and this statement is how they get to be it.
 *
 * <p><strong>And no {@code deleteBy...} beyond the two below.</strong> Withdrawal
 * removes the row rather than stamping it — see the header of {@code V10} for why
 * that is a deliberate departure from §7.3's soft delete.

    /**
     * Records a reminder, or does nothing because it is already recorded.
     *
     * <p>Native because JPQL has no {@code ON CONFLICT}, and the conflict is the
     * point: the database decides whether this call created the row, and both
     * outcomes are success as far as the caller is concerned. Exactly one of
     * {@code userId} and {@code email} is non-null; {@code reminders_one_identity}
     * refuses the rest.
     *
     * <p>The cast on {@code email} is required rather than cosmetic. A JDBC
     * parameter binds as {@code varchar}, and PostgreSQL will not choose the
     * {@code citext} unique index for a {@code varchar} comparison — so without
     * it, {@code ON CONFLICT} would not match the index it is meant to match and
     * the statement would fail to compile against the table.
     *
     * <p>{@code DO NOTHING} rather than {@code DO UPDATE}: a repeat registration
     * must not write to the row at all. The alternative would have been to rotate
     * the unsubscribe token on every call, and the row of somebody who has already
     * asked is not something an unauthenticated caller who knows their address
     * should be able to change.
     *
     * @return 1 when this call created the row, 0 when it already existed. Both are
     *     success; the caller uses it only to decide what to log
