/**
 * One campaign, decided by §5.1 and announced, in one transaction.
 *
 * <p><strong>The transaction boundary is the whole reason this class exists</strong>
 * rather than being three lines inside {@link CampaignFinalizerJob}. Three things have to
 * commit together:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>the {@code LIVE → SUCCESSFUL} or {@code LIVE → UNSUCCESSFUL} edge, with its row in
 *       {@code project_state_transitions};
 *   <li>V29's frozen outcome, which is the evidence for that edge;
 *   <li>the {@code project.succeeded} or {@code project.unsuccessful} outbox event, which
 *       is how everybody who backed the campaign finds out.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Any two of the three without the third is a distinct kind of wrong. A state without
 * an event is a campaign that closed and told nobody. An event without a state is a
 * backer told their campaign succeeded and a page that still shows a countdown. A state
 * without a frozen outcome is a decision with no evidence, which V29 argues at length
 * will read as the opposite decision once collections start failing.
 *
 * <p><strong>And one campaign per transaction, not one pass per transaction.</strong> A
 * batch that shared a transaction would make one campaign's failure roll back every
 * campaign the pass had already closed, and — worse — would hold the outbox insert of the
 * first campaign open until the last one finished. The sweep above catches the failure
 * per campaign and carries on, which is {@code ReservationCleanerJob}'s arrangement and
 * for the same reason: every campaign behind this one also has backers waiting to be
 * told.
 *
 * <h2>What this does not do</h2>
 *
 * <p><strong>It collects nothing.</strong> §5.1's successful branch says "collect every
 * confirmed pledge", and that is {@code batched collection at campaign close} (#64), which
 * moves {@code SUCCESSFUL → COLLECTING} and works from the state this job writes. §6.1
 * makes them two states precisely so that deciding and charging are two decisions with a
 * durable record between them — a platform that decided and charged in one transaction
 * could not tell you, after a crash, which of the two it had done.
 *
 * <p><strong>It purges nothing.</strong> §5.1's unsuccessful branch deletes stored card
 * tokens within thirty days, which is §8.4's {@code token-cleaner} and which reads the
 * same state. Thirty days is not this job's minute.
