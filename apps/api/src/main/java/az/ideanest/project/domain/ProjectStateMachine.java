 * are data here, so the whole rule can be read in one screen and asserted
 * against the specification in a unit test. Written as {@code if (state ==
 * SUBMITTED && ...)} spread across the services that perform each transition,
 * the same rule becomes a thing nobody can enumerate, and the question "can a
 * suspended campaign go live again" acquires as many answers as there are call
 * sites.
 *
 * <p><strong>No Spring and no database.</strong> Nothing here is injected,
 * loaded, or persisted, which is what makes {@code ProjectStateMachineTests}
 * a plain unit test that starts no container. The rule that decides whether a
 * campaign may start taking money should not need PostgreSQL to be checked.
 *
 * <p>This type answers the question and does not perform the move.
 * {@code ProjectTransitionService} is the only thing that performs it, because a
 * transition is not complete until it has been recorded.
