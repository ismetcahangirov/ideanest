/**
 * Creating a campaign and editing its basics.
 *
 * <p>Everything except the state, which is {@link ProjectTransitionService} and
 * only that. The split is the point: a service that could both edit a field and
 * move a state would eventually do both in one method, and the audit row would
 * become a thing that describes some of the change.
 *
 * <p><strong>Validation is here as well as in the database.</strong> Every rule
 * below is also a check constraint on {@code projects}. The constraint is what
 * holds against a support query, a bulk import, and a bug; this is what turns the
 * same rule into a 400 naming the field, because a constraint violation reaches
 * the client as a 500 and tells them nothing they can act on.
 *
 * <p><strong>Which fields are editable in which state is not decided here.</strong>
 * {@link ProjectEditLocks} is the table, in {@code domain}, and this service asks
 * it — the same table {@code RewardService} asks about a tier's price, and the same
 * one {@code ProjectEditResponses} turns into the {@code lockedFields} a client
 * reads. A launched campaign's goal, duration, and scheduled launch are refused
 * here with a 409 before a single field is applied; see
 * {@link #requireNothingLocked}.
