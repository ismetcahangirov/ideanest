/**
 * §8.4's {@code reminder-sender}, in the half of it this issue owns.
 *
 * <p>The table gives the job two responsibilities, "launch and deadline
 * reminders". Only the first is here: a deadline reminder needs a campaign with a
 * deadline, a notification preference model, and the "48 hours remaining" and "24
 * hours remaining" rows of §4.10, none of which exist. Writing half of it now
 * would be a job that looks finished.
 *
 * <p><strong>On the durable scheduler since #134.</strong> The sweep did not need
 * the lease to be correct — {@link LaunchReminderDelivery} claims each row with a
 * conditional update, so exactly one caller sends and the others find it already
 * done — but it is the job where doing the work three times was most visible: every
 * replica read the same list of campaigns owed notices, every minute, and two of
 * them threw the answer away.
 *
 * <p>This one is <em>not</em> indifferent to running late. A launch notice that
 * arrives an hour after the campaign opened is a worse message than one that arrives
 * in a minute, which is why {@link LaunchReminderListener} exists beside it rather
 * than instead of it — and why the lease is a minute rather than an hour.
