/**
 * What a campaign has raised: {@code projects.pledged_amount} and {@code backers_count} — IDN-EXT-01 (#39).
 *
 * <p><strong>The first writer those two columns have had.</strong> §5.1 has always decided a campaign
 * on {@code pledged_amount}, and §4.3 sorts and bands on it, but nothing in production moved it:
 * the entity maps both columns read-only and no statement or trigger wrote them. Under IDN-EXT-01 a
 * pledge is paid for when it is confirmed, so a paid pledge is exactly what should count, and the
 * pledge module calls this in the transaction that collects it.
 *
 * <p>One statement that adds, rather than a read and a write: two backers paying at the same moment
 * must not each read the old total and overwrite the other.
