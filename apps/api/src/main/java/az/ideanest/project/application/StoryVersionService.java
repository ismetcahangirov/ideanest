/**
 * The story's editing history: writing it, reading it, and restoring from it.
 *
 * <p><strong>The write is not an endpoint.</strong> The story is saved through
 * {@code PATCH /v1/projects/{id}} like every other field (contract §5), so
 * {@link #recordIfDue} is called by {@link ProjectEditingService} on that path.
 * A separate "save a version" call would be a second way to write a story, and
 * the two would eventually disagree about which document version 7 holds.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why a version is not written on every save.</strong> The editor
 * autosaves a few hundred milliseconds after somebody stops typing, so a version
 * per save is one row per sentence — several thousand {@code jsonb} documents for
 * an afternoon's work, and a history whose entries differ by one word each. The
 * rule is therefore: a version is written when the story actually changed
 * <em>and</em> the newest version is older than
 * {@code ideanest.project.story.version-interval}. That turns continuous typing
 * into one row every five minutes, which is a list a person can read and a loss of
 * at most five minutes of writing.
 *
 * <p>The comparison is between documents rather than between strings — see
 * {@link StoryDocuments#isSameDocument} — so a client that reordered two keys has
 * not changed anything and does not gain a row claiming it did.
 *
 * <p><strong>A version holds the document as it now is</strong>, not the one it
 * replaced. The newest version is therefore usually a copy of
 * {@code projects.story}, and restoring version <em>n</em> means "make the story
 * what it was at version <em>n</em>". Storing the previous document instead would
 * be off by one everywhere it is read: the number beside a timestamp would
 * describe the writing that existed before that moment, which is not what
 * "version 7, 14:32" means to anybody looking at a list.
