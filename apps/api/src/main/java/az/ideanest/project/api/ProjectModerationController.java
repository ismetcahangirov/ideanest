/**
 * The three moderation outcomes for a submitted campaign.
 *
 * <p>In the {@code project} module rather than in {@code moderation} because all
 * three do exactly one thing: move this state machine. The moderation module owns
 * the queue, the case, the reports that feed it, and the reviewer's workflow, and
 * when it exists it will call these same transitions. Putting three endpoints there
 * first would mean a module whose only content is a call into another module's
 * service.
 *
 * <p><strong>There is no role model yet, so staff is a configured list of
 * addresses.</strong> Nothing in the schema, the access token, or
 * {@code SecurityConfiguration} distinguishes platform staff from anybody else, and
 * epic #100 owns that. Until it lands, {@code ideanest.project.moderation
 * .moderator-emails} is what these three endpoints check, through
 * {@code ProjectAccess.requireModeratable} — one method, called by all three, rather
 * than an annotation somebody forgets on the fourth. The list is empty by default,
 * which means no account can moderate anything until a deployment says who can.
 *
 * <p>The alternatives were worse. Requiring only a valid access token — which is all
 * the filter chain can enforce on its own — lets a creator approve their own
 * campaign, and moderation exists to prevent exactly that. So does "the creator may
 * not approve their own", one free second account later. A claim carried in the
 * request is not authorisation at all. Configuration is the one option that fails
 * closed and that epic #100 can replace by deleting it.
