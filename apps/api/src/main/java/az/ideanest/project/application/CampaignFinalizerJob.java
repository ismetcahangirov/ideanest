/**
 * §8.4's {@code campaign-finalizer}, every minute: applies §5.1 at the deadline.
 *
 * <p><strong>This is the job the platform is built around.</strong> Every other sweep in
 * §8.4 keeps something tidy or moves something along; this one is the moment a campaign
 * stops being a page and becomes an obligation. Until it ran, a campaign whose deadline
 * had passed simply stayed {@code LIVE} — the state machine has had the edge since #31 and
 * nothing performed it, so a funded campaign would have gone on counting down for ever and
 * nobody would have been charged.
 *
 * <h2>Why a minute is the right lateness</h2>
 *
 * <p>A deadline is a promise to backers and creators about a wall-clock moment, and a job
 * that ran hourly would close a campaign up to an hour after the countdown reached zero —
 * an hour in which the page says "0 minutes left" and the campaign is still taking money.
 * A minute is small enough to read as the same moment and large enough that the sweep
 * costs one indexed lookup that usually returns nothing.
 *
 * <p><strong>Late is safe here, and early would not be.</strong> The pass compares each
 * campaign's stored deadline against its own instant, under the lock, so a run that starts
 * ten minutes late closes exactly the campaigns that would have closed on time and gives
 * every one of them the same outcome. What it costs is that pledges made in those ten
 * minutes count — which is the correct answer, because a pledge the platform accepted is
 * a pledge the platform accepted.
 *
 * <h2>The claim, and why the lease is not it</h2>
 *
 * <p>On the durable scheduler like every job since #134, so a fleet of replicas produces
 * one sweep rather than one per replica. The lease is <em>not</em> what makes this
 * correct: §8.4 is explicit that a run outlasting its lease is joined by a second replica
 * part-way through. What prevents a campaign being closed twice is
 * {@link ProjectTransitionService#finalise} claiming the row with
 * {@code findByIdForUpdate} and re-reading the state under the lock — the second caller
 * waits, finds {@code SUCCESSFUL}, and does nothing. That matters more here than anywhere
 * else in §8.4: closing a campaign twice would record two decisions and publish two
 * events, and the second event is ten thousand duplicate notifications about somebody's
 * money.

     * behind it from closing — those are other people's campaigns, and the alternative is
     * one bad row holding the entire platform's deadlines open. The failure is logged at
     * {@code ERROR} naming the campaign, the row stays {@code LIVE}, and the next pass
     * tries again.
