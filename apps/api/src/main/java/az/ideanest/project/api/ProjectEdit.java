/**
 * A campaign as its creator's editor sees it.
 *
 * <p>The response of every endpoint in this module that changes something. One
 * shape rather than one per action, so that a client applies the same update to
 * its state after a save, a submission, and a moderation decision — and so that
 * an endpoint cannot quietly start returning a field the others do not.
 *
 * <p>This is the <em>creator's</em> projection and not the public one. It carries
 * the state, the scheduled launch, and the fields nobody outside the campaign may
 * see; the public project page is a different response owned by a different issue.
 *
 * <p><strong>Nulls are written out.</strong> The service is configured with
 * {@code default-property-inclusion: non_null}, which is right for most responses
 * and wrong for this one: the editor binds a form to every field here, and an
 * absent key cannot be told from a field that is genuinely unset. That is the same
 * distinction the {@code PATCH} body depends on, in the other direction.
 *
 * @param goal the funding target, as an amount and a currency. The amount is a
 *     string on the wire — §10.3, and {@link Money} for why
 * @param lockedFields which fields may no longer be changed, given the state the
 *     campaign is in. Empty until launch; from {@code LIVE} onwards it lists
 *     {@code goal}, {@code durationDays}, and {@code scheduledLaunchAt}, which §5.3
 *     freezes because §5.1 resolves a campaign against them. The names are the keys
 *     of the {@code PATCH} body, so a client matches them directly against its own
 *     inputs and disables them; a client that does not is answered
 *     {@code 409 PROJECT_FIELD_LOCKED} when it tries. A reward's price is frozen by
 *     the same rule and is deliberately not listed here — it is not a field of this
 *     body. See {@code ProjectEditLocks}
