/**
 * A partial edit of a campaign's basics.
 *
 * <p>Every field is a {@link Patched} because the campaign editor autosaves: a
 * body containing only the title must leave the summary alone, and one containing
 * {@code "blurb": null} must clear it. See {@link Patched} for why
 * {@link java.util.Optional} cannot express that.
 *
 * <p>The story is a JSON tree rather than the text that reaches the column.
 * {@code StoryDocuments} validates it and {@code StoryVersionService} compares it
 * against the newest stored version, and both of those are questions about a
 * document rather than about a string — key order and whitespace are not edits.
 * The conversion to text happens once, in {@link ProjectEditingService}, at the
 * point the validated document is stored.
 *
 * <p>Fields that belong to other issues are deliberately absent: the pre-launch
 * page (#39) and collaborators (#38) are transitions and grants rather than
 * basics, and neither is edited through this record.
