/**
 * Where in the campaign editor a requirement is fixed.
 *
 * <p><strong>A checklist that says what is wrong and not where to fix it is a
 * list of complaints.</strong> "The story is 140 characters" is only actionable
 * if the creator can get to the story from the sentence that says so, and the
 * section is what lets the client make each failing row a link rather than a
 * paragraph the creator has to translate into navigation.
 *
 * <p>The keys are the campaign editor's route segments — {@code EDITOR_TABS} in
 * {@code apps/web/src/components/campaign-editor/tabs.ts} — because that is what
 * the client builds the link out of. They are therefore part of the wire
 * contract: renaming one is a change to the client's routing as well as to this
 * enum, which is the correct amount of friction.
 *
 * <p>Only the sections a requirement actually points at exist here. A value for
 * a tab nothing sends anybody to would be a value the client has to handle and
 * can never receive, which is how a client acquires a branch nobody has ever run.
