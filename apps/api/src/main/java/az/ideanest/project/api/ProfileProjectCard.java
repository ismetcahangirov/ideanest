/**
 * A campaign as a card on somebody's profile, on the wire — §4.2's created and backed tabs.
 *
 * <p><strong>One record, used by two modules, declared here because {@code projects} is
 * this module's table.</strong> {@code GET /v1/users/{slug}/projects} is served from this
 * module and {@code GET /v1/users/{slug}/backed} from the pledge module, and they render
 * the same grid on the same page — a reader switching tabs must not find that a cover image
 * is called something else on one of them. Two records would be that difference waiting to
 * happen, and the second one to gain a field is the one nobody notices. The pledge module
 * imports this type, which is the direction {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} already permits and
 * {@code PublicBackers} already takes.
 *
 * <p><strong>Every amount is §10.3's {@code {"amount", "currency"}} object with a string
 * amount</strong>, because {@link Money} carries its own serialiser and there is therefore
 * no call site here that could produce a JSON number. On a card whose subject is how much a
 * campaign has raised, that is not a formality.
 *
 * <p><strong>Nulls are written out.</strong> {@code goal} is absent on a {@code PRELAUNCH}
 * campaign and {@code coverImage} on one nobody has illustrated, and a grid renderer that
 * could not tell an unset field from a key it failed to read would show a spinner where a
 * placeholder belongs. {@code ProjectPageResponse} omits its nulls and is right to — it
 * feeds one page where absent and empty mean the same thing — and this feeds a list where
 * the client branches on each field per row.
 *
 * <p><strong>No story, no risks, no taxonomy, no outcome.</strong> Those are the campaign
 * page's, they are already served by {@code GET /v1/projects/{creatorSlug}/{projectSlug}},
 * and a profile that carried them would fetch twenty story documents to render twenty
 * titles. The two slugs are here instead, which is how a client builds the link to that
 * page — the whole path, because one slug alone addresses nothing.
 *
 * @param state one of §6.1's states, by name. Nine of them on the two public tabs; a
 *     backer's own pledge list can carry any of the sixteen, which is deliberate and is
 *     argued in {@code ProfileCampaigns.ofAnyState}
 * @param pledged what the campaign has raised now, which on a closed campaign keeps moving
 *     as collections fail. The frozen outcome that does not is on the campaign page, and a
 *     card is not where somebody reads a final result
 * @param creatorSlug null only when the campaign's creator row could not be joined. The two
 *     public tabs exclude those rows rather than serving a half-built link
