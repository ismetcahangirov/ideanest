/**
 * §4.7's CD-01: what a campaign has raised, from whom, and how long it has left.
 *
 * <p>The creator's counterpart of {@link PublicProjectPage}, and deliberately not a
 * variant of it. That projection carries the story, the cover image and the taxonomy,
 * because it renders a page for a stranger; this carries four numbers and two instants,
 * because it renders a header that refreshes. Folding them together would give the
 * dashboard a story document it never displays and give the public page an authorisation
 * check it does not need.
 *
 * <h2>The clock is two instants, not a countdown</h2>
 *
 * <p><strong>There is no {@code secondsRemaining}, and that is the one decision in this
 * record worth arguing.</strong> Computing the remainder here and sending a number means
 * the number is wrong the moment it is sent and grows more wrong for as long as the page
 * stays open — and a creator watching the last hour of their campaign is the reader most
 * likely to leave it open.
 *
 * <p>So the deadline goes out as an instant, and {@link #serverTime()} goes with it. A
 * client subtracts the two once to learn how far its own clock is off, and then counts
 * down against its own. That also fixes the case a countdown cannot: a reader whose
 * machine is a day out is told the truth rather than being told it twice.
 *
 * @param state one of §6.1's sixteen, by name — every consumer is outside the module that
 *     owns the enum
 * @param goal null before launch. §5.3 requires one by submission, so a draft has none
 * @param raised {@code projects.pledged_amount}, which is never null
 * @param percentFunded {@code raised / goal}, as a percentage, or null when there is no
 *     goal to be a percentage of. <strong>Rounded down, and not capped.</strong> Down,
 *     because a campaign at 99.99% has not reached its goal and a dashboard that rounded
 *     it to 100 would say it had — the one number on this screen a creator acts on.
 *     Uncapped, because a campaign at 240% should say so
 * @param serverTime when this answer was computed. See above
 * @param outcome null until the deadline has been decided, and V29's frozen figures after
 *     — the same fields, and the same reason, as {@code PublicProjectPage.Outcome}: a
 *     later collection failure reduces the payout and never the outcome, so a dashboard
 *     reporting only the live total would contradict the word beside it
