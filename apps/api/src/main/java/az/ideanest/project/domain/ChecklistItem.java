/**
 * One requirement, and how this campaign stands against it.
 *
 * @param requirement which rule this is. Carries its own severity and the editor
 *     section that fixes it, so nothing downstream has to decide either
 * @param satisfied whether the campaign meets it right now
 * @param detail why it is not met, as a sentence a creator can act on, and
 *     <strong>null when it is</strong>. Not "Done": a satisfied requirement has
 *     nothing to say that {@link ChecklistRequirement#label()} does not already
 *     say, and inventing prose for it would give a client two strings to render
 *     where one carries the meaning. The sentence quotes the campaign's own
 *     numbers — "The story is 140 characters; at least 500 are needed" — because
 *     "the story is too short" is a restatement of the rule rather than a report
 *     about this campaign
