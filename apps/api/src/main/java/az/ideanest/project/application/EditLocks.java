/**
 * What §5.3 has frozen on a campaign, for a module that may not name a campaign.
 *
 * <p>The reward module enforces two of the five rules in {@link ProjectEditLocks} —
 * a tier's price and the direction its quantity may move — and it cannot read them
 * itself: {@link Project} and {@link ProjectState} live in this module's
 * {@code domain} package, which {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} forbids another module
 * from reaching into. Modules talk through their application layer, and this is
 * that sentence for the one question the reward module has to ask.
 *
 * <p><strong>Answers, not the table.</strong> The components are booleans and a
 * state name rather than the {@link LockedField} values they came from, so nothing
 * outside this module holds a copy of the vocabulary and no caller can be tempted
 * to re-derive "has it launched" from a set it was handed. When a sixth rule is
 * added to the table, the modules that care gain a component here and the ones that
 * do not are unaffected.
 *
 * @param state the campaign's state, by name, because a refusal has to say what
 *     refused it and the reward module has no enum to say it with
 * @param rewardPriceLocked whether {@code price} may no longer be changed
 * @param rewardQuantityLoweringLocked whether a tier's {@code limitQuantity} may
 *     only be raised. Not "may not be changed": §5.3 permits raising it at any
 *     time, and a name that said otherwise would invite the wrong refusal
