/**
 * A creator's campaign: creating it, editing it, and moving it through its life.
 *
 * <p>Eight endpoints. Seven answer {@link ProjectEdit}; the eighth is the
 * completeness checklist, which is about the campaign rather than of it. The four
 * that change state do nothing themselves — they name a transition and hand it to
 * {@link ProjectTransitionService}, which is the only thing in the service that
 * writes {@code projects.state} and the only thing that records having done so.
 *
 * <p>The public half of the pre-launch page is deliberately somewhere else:
 * {@code PrelaunchController} serves the page and collects reminders, and it is a
 * separate controller because everything here requires a bearer token and nothing
 * there does.
 *
 * <p>Authorisation is not decided here either. Every method passes the caller's
 * identifier down, and {@code ProjectAccess} decides what that identifier is
 * allowed to reach — one place, so that #38 widening it to collaborators changes
 * one file rather than six methods.
 *
 * <p>The subject of the access token is where the caller comes from, never a path
 * or body parameter. A creator identifier a client could choose would let anybody
 * edit anybody's campaign.
