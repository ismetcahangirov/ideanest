/**
 * A partial edit of a campaign, with JSON Merge-Patch semantics (RFC 7396).
 *
 * <p>Every field is a {@link Patched}: a field the client did not mention is left
 * alone and a field explicitly set to {@code null} is cleared. The campaign editor
 * autosaves one field at a time, so a body containing only a title is the normal
 * case — and reading that as "set the title, clear everything else" would delete a
 * creator's work in a request that looks entirely ordinary in a log.
 *
 * <p>Bean validation annotations are deliberately absent. They cannot see inside a
 * {@code Patched}, and a rule enforced here as well as in
 * {@code ProjectEditingService} would be two rules that can disagree — with the
 * service's version being the one that also holds for every other caller. The
 * lengths and ranges of §5.3 are checked there, and in the database beneath it.
 *
 * @param story the rich-text document, as a tree. Validated against contract §5 by
 *     {@code StoryDocuments} on the editing service's path rather than here, so
 *     that the rule holds for every caller of that service and not only for
 *     requests that arrive through this controller

     * <p>One conversion happens here: the cover image becomes the value object that

     * "absent" and "cleared", which is what {@link Patched#map} exists for.
     *
     * <p>The story crosses unchanged, as a tree. It used to be flattened to text
     * here, with a check that it was at least a JSON object; both moved to
     * {@code StoryDocuments}, which validates the whole document on the editing
     * service's path. Validating in this record would have put the rule in the HTTP
     * layer, where it holds for requests that arrive through this controller and for
     * nothing else.
