/**
 * The project module answering what a campaign is filed under — issue #311.
 *
 * <p>The implementing half of {@link CampaignCategories}, and the same arrangement as
 * {@code ProjectSummaryLookup} implementing {@code shared.project.ProjectSummaries}: the
 * module that owns {@code projects} answers questions about it, and the module that asks
 * names a question rather than a table.
 *
 * <p><strong>It reads every state, not only the public ones.</strong> A payout is
 * calculated for a campaign that has closed, and several of §6.1's closed states are not
 * public — going through {@code PublicProjects} would answer "no category" for exactly the
 * campaigns this is asked about, and every one of them would quietly price against the
 * platform default.
