/**
 * V65's versions, by the five questions asked of them — issue #425.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@link #inForce} is the one on a hot path</strong> — every campaign submission
 * and every pledge confirmation asks it — and it is the one V65's
 * {@code legal_documents_in_force} partial index exists for. It is deliberately a query
 * about the whole kind rather than about one language: a version is published in every
 * language it has been translated into under one number, and the governing row is the
 * Azerbaijani one, so the answer is "the highest version of this kind whose effective date
 * has arrived" and the locale is chosen from that answer.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@link #draftOf} is what makes V65's one-draft-per-(kind, locale) index a
 * usable rule</strong> rather than a constraint violation an administrator meets after
 * typing a page of terms. The index is still what makes it true under a race.
