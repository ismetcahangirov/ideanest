/**
 * §22.2's documents: drafted, published once, and read by everybody — issue #425.
 *
 * <h2>Two audiences, and only one of them is authorised</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #inForce} and {@link #published} are public: these are the pages a stranger and
 * a regulator read, and a terms of use behind authentication is a document nobody can
 * decide to be bound by. Everything that writes needs
 * {@link StaffCapability#CONFIGURE_PLATFORM}, which only {@code ADMINISTRATOR} holds — the
 * same authority that changes a fee schedule or a plan, because it is the same kind of
 * decision: one screen, changing what the running platform obliges everybody to.
 *
 * <p>The capability is checked here rather than by an annotation on the controller,
 * following {@code SubscriptionPlans} and {@code FeeSchedules}: this is also where the
 * change is recorded, and an authorised action nobody recorded and a recorded action nobody
 * authorised are the same defect from opposite ends.
 *
 * <p>#436 gives publishing its own row in §3.1's matrix and its own capability. Narrowing
 * it is a change to one {@code requireCapability} call, which is why it is written as one.
 *
 * <h2>Publishing is per document, not per translation</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #publish} takes a kind and publishes <strong>every open draft of it, in every
 * language, under one version number and one effective date.</strong> Three consequences,
 * all of them the point:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Version 4 of the creator agreement is version 4 in all four languages, so an
 *       acceptance naming a version identifies one agreement rather than one translation of
 *       an unknown one.
 *   <li>A publication cannot half-happen. Publishing Azerbaijani on Tuesday and English on
 *       Friday would leave three days in which what a reader agreed to and what governed
 *       them were different documents.
 *   <li><strong>Nothing publishes without the Azerbaijani text.</strong> That is the text
 *       that governs; the other three exist so a person can read what they are agreeing to.
 *       A publication missing it would be a platform binding people to a document it does
 *       not have.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Nothing is deleted and nothing published is edited</h2>
 *
 * <p>There is no delete method and no edit-after-publication method. V65's trigger refuses
 * both underneath, and {@code LegalDocument} refuses them above; what is here is the third
 * place the rule is stated, which is the absence of an entry point. A correction is
 * {@link #draft} followed by {@link #publish}, and the previous version stays readable
 * because somebody who accepted it is entitled to read what they accepted.
