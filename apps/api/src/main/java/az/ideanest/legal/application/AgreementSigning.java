/**
 * Signing the creator agreement, and binding the signature to the acceptance — issue #429.
 *
 * <p>#425 records that somebody accepted a version and #428 can obtain a legally binding
 * signature. This is the join, for the one document where the difference is worth the friction:
 * the creator agreement, which moves delivery liability onto a named person and lets the
 * platform recover a chargeback from them.
 *
 * <h2>What is signed is the hash of the text</h2>
 *
 * <p>Not the title, not a description, not an identifier. #429: "that is the whole reason #425
 * stores the body and hashes it: the record has to prove <em>which text</em>, and a signature
 * over a title proves nothing." The hash comes from {@code legal_documents.content_hash} of the
 * governing (Azerbaijani) version, at the moment the session starts, and is compared again when
 * the signature comes back. A signature over a version that is no longer in force does not
 * satisfy the current one — that is a test, and it is the test this design exists to pass.
 *
 * <h2>The name match, which #429 calls the point</h2>
 *
 * <p>Three names have to agree about one person: the certificate subject (#428), the account's
 * legal name (#430), and — when #432 lands — the holder of the payout destination. Two of the
 * three are checkable here and both are checked.
 *
 * <p><strong>A mismatch is a refusal with a reason, and the reason is one the product already
 * has words for.</strong> {@link RejectionReason#MISMATCHED_NAME} is a value V58 already
 * defines, for exactly this. V58's argument for a closed set applies unchanged: "a reason a
 * creator is shown has to be one the product has written words for, and a free-text field is
 * where somebody eventually pastes what they saw on the document."
 *
 * <h2>For a legal entity, and what this deliberately does not claim</h2>
 *
 * <p>SİMA signs as a citizen. It does not assert that the citizen may bind a company. So for a
 * {@code LEGAL_ENTITY} the signature proves who signed, and #430's registration extract — read
 * by a human in #431's queue — is what says whether they could.
 *
 * <p><strong>This code does not check that pairing and does not pretend to.</strong> #429 asks
 * for the gap to be flagged explicitly rather than assumed away, because "the director signed
 * it" is the assumption that is wrong for exactly the companies where it matters. If #423's
 * opinion says a signature plus an extract is insufficient, the extra step goes here, and it
 * will find a name match and an audited signature already in place to hang off.
