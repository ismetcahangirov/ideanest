/**
 * §22.2's documents, as anybody may read them — issues #425 and #439.
 *
 * <h2>Public, because that is the whole point of them</h2>
 *
 * <p>These are the pages a stranger and a regulator read. A terms of use behind
 * authentication is a document nobody can decide to be bound by, and §22.3 asks for a risk
 * statement and a fee disclosure that a person sees <em>before</em> they commit — which
 * means before they have an account.
 *
 * <h2>Cacheable, and by a shared cache</h2>
 *
 * <p>Nothing in any answer here belongs to a person: it is the same text for everybody, and
 * it changes a few times a year. That is the one shape a {@code public} cache directive is
 * actually correct for, and it is what stops eight documents in four languages being read
 * out of PostgreSQL on every footer render.
 *
 * <p>An hour rather than a day. The lag matters in one direction only — a version published
 * this morning should be what somebody accepting this afternoon is shown — and an hour bounds
 * that without making the pages dynamic. The gates check the database on every submission and
 * every confirmation, so a stale page can never produce a stale acceptance.
