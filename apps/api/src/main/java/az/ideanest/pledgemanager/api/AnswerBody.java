/**
 * One answer, in a submission and in a response.
 *
 * <p>Always an array, whatever the question's type — the shape {@code SurveyAnswer}
 * argues for, carried unchanged to the wire so that a client has one branch rather than
 * five. A single-choice answer is a one-element array.
 *
 * <p>The values are the option text a backer was shown, not indices into the question's
 * option list. An index would break the moment a creator reordered the options, and it
 * would break silently.
