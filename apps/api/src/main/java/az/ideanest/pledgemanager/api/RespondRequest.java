/**
 * A backer's answers to one survey — §4.8's PM-05.
 *
 * <p>The whole set, not a patch: a survey is a form and it is submitted as one. A
 * partial submission would leave the creator unable to tell "they left it blank" from
 * "the client did not send that field", which is exactly the distinction a required
 * question exists to draw.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code pledgeId} is in the body rather than the path</strong>, and it has
 * to be somewhere: what a backer is asked depends on the tier their pledge names
 * (PM-02), and one account can hold pledges on several campaigns. It cannot be inferred
 * from the survey alone. The server still checks that the pledge is the caller's — the
 * field says <em>which</em> of their pledges, never <em>whose</em>.
 *
 * @param answers a question may appear once. A second entry for the same question is
 *     refused rather than resolved by order, because either resolution is a guess about
 *     what somebody meant to manufacture
