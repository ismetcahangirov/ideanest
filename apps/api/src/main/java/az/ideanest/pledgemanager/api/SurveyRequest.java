/**
 * A survey as its creator is asking for it.
 *
 * <p>The whole thing, questions included — a question left out of the body is one they
 * deleted. Merging would leave a question on the form that the creator believes they
 * removed, and they would find out from the responses.
 *
 * <p>Used by both {@code POST} and {@code PUT}, because a survey is created and
 * rewritten with the same body: there is nothing a creation needs that an edit does
 * not, and two shapes would be two things to keep in step.
 *
 * @param respondBy PM-06's cut-off, or null for none — which is not "closed"
