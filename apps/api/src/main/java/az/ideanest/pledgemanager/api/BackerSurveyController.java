/**
 * §4.8's PM-05 and PM-06 over HTTP, for the backer.
 *
 * <p><strong>A separate controller from {@code SurveyController}</strong>, although
 * both are about surveys, because the two have nothing in common but the noun. This one
 * takes no campaign identifier, checks no capability, and returns a projection that
 * omits the recipient and response counts — how many other people answered is the
 * creator's business, and a client should not have to be trusted to hide it.
 *
 * <p>Splitting them also keeps the exception advice honest: a backer's refusals are
 * about their own pledge, and a creator's are about a capability.
 *
 * <p>Both endpoints require a bearer token by falling through to
 * {@code SecurityConfiguration}'s catch-all, and both are {@code no-store}: what a
 * backer told a campaign about themselves is not something a shared cache should hold.
