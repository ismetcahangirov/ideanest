 * <p>Every value has a default that a deployment configuring nothing still gets,
 * following {@code CommunityProperties}: binding leaves an omitted property at its
 * zero value, and a page size of zero is a screen that always looks empty.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@link Addresses} is the exception, and deliberately so.</strong> There
 * is no default encryption key. A platform that generated one at start-up would
 * encrypt every address under a key that changes on the next deploy, which is worse
 * than not encrypting them — the rows become unreadable and nobody finds out until a
 * creator tries to ship. So an unconfigured deployment starts, and refuses the first
 * write of an address with a message naming the property. See that record.

     * endpoint, and refuses the first write of an address with a message naming this

     *
     * <p><strong>Why start at all rather than fail fast.</strong> The addresses
     * feature is one endpoint of a hundred. A missing key stopping the whole service
     * would take discovery, checkout and the creator dashboard down over a feature the
     * deployment may not have reached yet — and would do it at the worst moment, which
     * is a rolling deploy that has already replaced half the fleet.

     * @param primaryKeyId which key new addresses are sealed under. Rotation is: add
     *     the new key to {@code keys}, deploy, then move this label — so that every
     *     instance can read the new key before any instance writes under it
     * @param keys label to base64 key material, 32 bytes each for AES-256. Old keys
     *     stay here after a rotation so that rows written under them remain readable;
