/**
 * Audit rows.
 *
 * <p><strong>Read and insert, and the interface says so.</strong>
 * {@link JpaRepository} brings {@code delete}, {@code deleteAll} and
 * {@code deleteAllInBatch} with it, and every one of them is a statement V21's
 * trigger refuses — so calling one is a runtime failure rather than a compile
 * failure, which is the one thing about this file worth knowing. Narrowing to
 * {@code Repository} and declaring five methods by hand would fix that and cost the
 * paging, sorting and flushing the writing side actually uses; the enforcement that
 * matters is in the database, and it does not care which interface asked.
 *
 * <p>The two unpaged finders are the two questions §7.2 says this table exists to
 * answer. The paged ones below them are the same questions asked by AD-14's viewer
 * (#314), which cannot read an unbounded list into a browser; every one of the four
 * shapes is index-backed by V21, and {@link az.ideanest.audit.AuditTrailFilter} explains
 * why there are four and not an arbitrary combination.
 *
 * <h2>Ordered by {@code occurred_at}, and it used to be by the identifier</h2>
 *
 * <p>The old argument was that both columns say the same thing — the identifier is a UUID
 * v7 and carries the millisecond it was minted in (§7.3) — and that only one of them is
 * unique, so ordering by the primary key gave the same sequence with a cursor that was one
 * value. The two columns are written by two different clocks, and #404 is what that cost:
 * the identifier is minted in the application when the row is built, {@code occurred_at} is
 * {@code DEFAULT now()} and is taken when the insert lands, and the viewer displays the
 * second while the query ordered by the first. A page headed "newest first" opened on last
 * month.
 *
 * <p>So every query below orders by {@code (occurred_at DESC, id DESC)} — the column the
 * screen shows, with the key breaking the tie — and the keyset predicate is the row-value
 * comparison that pair implies, written out rather than as a tuple because JPQL has no
 * row constructor. Two rows written by one transaction share an instant often enough that
 * the tie is the normal case here rather than the edge one, which is why the cursor carries
 * both halves. {@link AuditCursor} holds the whole argument.
 *
 * <p>The cost is stated rather than hidden, as it was before: V21's indexes all end in
 * {@code occurred_at DESC}, so this is now the index's own order on the filtered reads and
 * the tiebreak applies to the handful of rows sharing one timestamp. The unfiltered read
 * walks {@code audit_logs_occurred_at_idx} instead of the primary key. Adding {@code id} to
 * each index would make the keyset exact rather than nearly exact, and is an index rebuild
 * on the one table that only ever grows — worth doing on the day the tie is measurably
 * expensive, and not before.

     * The eight below are AD-14's viewer, and every one of them carries the same two extra
     * predicates since #404: `from` inclusive and `to` exclusive.
     *
     * Two parameters on eight queries rather than sixteen queries, which is the opposite of
     * the call `PaymentTransactionRepository` makes about its own status filter, and the
     * difference is where the column sits in the index. A status is not in any of V41's
     * indexes at all, so a filter on it either has its own query and its own index or it is a
     * scan — the plan genuinely differs. `occurred_at` is the *trailing* column of all four of
     * V21's indexes, so a bound on it is a narrower scan of the range the query had already
     * chosen, and the plan for a bounded read and an unbounded one is the same plan with
     * different endpoints. Doubling this file to express that would be sixteen methods
     * describing eight queries.
     *
     * **NEITHER BOUND IS EVER NULL, and that is not a style choice.** The obvious form is
     * `(:from IS NULL OR e.occurredAt >= :from)`, which is what `UserRepository.search` has
     * done with a String since #104. It does not work here: `:from IS NULL` gives Hibernate a
     * parameter with no type to infer from, and the whole of AD-14 answered 500 —
     * `AuditTrailOrderingApiTests` and every audit case in `ConsoleReadApiTests` went red
     * together, which is how this was found rather than shipped.
     *
     * So "no bound" is expressed as a bound that excludes nothing: `AuditTrailFilter.SINCE`
     * and `UNTIL` are the two ends of the column's useful range, and the caller substitutes
     * them for a null. The predicate is then a plain comparison against a typed path, the
     * planner sees an ordinary range scan over an index that is already ordered by this
     * column, and there is no untyped parameter anywhere in the file.
