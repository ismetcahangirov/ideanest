 * the point.</strong> The address, the user agent and §18.1's correlation
 * identifiers are the same four values at every call site, so passing them would be
 * four arguments per call that nobody reads and that one call site eventually gets
 * wrong or leaves out — and a row missing its correlation identifier is a row that
 * cannot be joined to the log lines of the request that produced it, discovered
 * during the incident rather than before it. They are also not the caller's to
 * choose: an actor who could name their own source address would be writing the
 * alibi as well as the record.
 *
 * <p>Everything is null when there is no request: a scheduled sweep has no client,
 * and a row that invented one would be worse than a row that says so.
 *
 * @param sourceAddress the address the container saw
 * @param userAgent what the client called itself, unredacted here and redacted by
 *     {@link AuditLog} on the way to the column
 * @param requestId §18.1's {@code requestId}, as
 *     {@code CorrelationFilter} established it
 * @param traceId §18.1's {@code traceId}, which is the caller's when the caller
 *     sent a well-formed {@code traceparent}
