/**
 * One of §7.2's six accounts, as a value rather than as a string somebody typed.
 *
 * <p>The vocabulary is closed: {@code escrow}, {@code creator:{id}},
 * {@code platform_fee}, {@code psp_fee}, {@code tax_payable}, {@code refunds}. V41's
 * check constraint is the enforcement and this is the only sanctioned way to produce
 * a value that satisfies it — which is the point of the type. A ledger whose accounts
 * are strings acquires a {@code platform_fees} within a year, and the sum that was
 * supposed to be the platform's revenue is then quietly two sums.
 *
 * <p><strong>Not an enum, because one of the six is parameterised.</strong>
 * {@code creator:{id}} is one account per creator, so the set is open at runtime and
 * closed in shape. An enum with a {@code CREATOR} constant would have to carry the
 * identifier somewhere else, and the two halves would travel separately through every
 * method that took an account.
 *
 * <p><strong>The currency is not part of an account.</strong> §21.2 refuses to convert
 * between currencies for anything that moves money, so a campaign's escrow in manat
 * and another's in dollars are the same account holding two balances that are never
 * added; the currency lives on the entry, and every balance is asked for in one.
