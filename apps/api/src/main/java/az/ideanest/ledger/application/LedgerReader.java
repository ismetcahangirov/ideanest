/**
 * §4.11's AD-05 ledger explorer, read — #305.
 *
 * <p>{@link Ledger} writes and this reads, and the split is the same one {@link
 * az.ideanest.audit.AuditLog} and {@code AuditTrail} make: the writing side is called by
 * every collection run and has one method that must be impossible to misuse, and the
 * reading side is called by one screen and pages. Putting the page query on {@code Ledger}
 * would mean the class that must refuse an unbalanced posting also carries a cursor.
 *
 * <p><strong>Two queries per page, and the second one is the point.</strong> The first
 * pages over postings; the second loads every entry of the postings it named, including
 * the entries the filter did not match. A ledger that showed you the escrow side of a
 * posting because you filtered on escrow would be showing half a double entry — see
 * {@link LedgerScope}.
 *
 * <p><strong>No authorisation and no audit row here</strong>, for {@code PaymentLog}'s
 * reason: the module that owns the table publishes the read, and
 * {@code admin.application.LedgerService} decides who may take it and records that they
 * did.
