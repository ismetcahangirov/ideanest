/**
 * §7.2's double entry, as the one door into it (#62).
 *
 * <p><strong>Every movement of money on the platform is written here, and only
 * here.</strong> §9.5's diagram has five destinations and four more issues to come —
 * refunds, chargebacks, payouts, tax — and the value of this class is that each of
 * them arrives as a {@link Posting} that has already been proved to balance rather
 * than as a pair of inserts somebody hopes agree.
 *
 * <h2>{@code MANDATORY}, and why that is the whole design</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link Propagation#MANDATORY} means this method refuses to run outside a
 * transaction somebody else started, which is the same choice {@code Outbox#record}
 * and the audit writer make, for a reason that is sharper here than for either.
 *
 * <p>A ledger posting is never the whole of what happened. It always accompanies
 * something else — a {@code transactions} row, a pledge moving to
 * {@code COLLECTED}, a payout being marked paid — and the two must be one commit.
 * A posting that committed on its own would be money moved against a charge nobody
 * recorded; a charge that committed on its own would be a collection that never
 * reached the creator's balance. Starting a transaction here, or joining whatever
 * happened to be open, would let either through quietly. Refusing says the
 * requirement out loud, at the first call site that forgets it, in a test rather
 * than in production.
 *
 * <h2>What this does not do</h2>
 *
 * <p><strong>It does not decide anything.</strong> It does not know what a fee is,
 * which account a collection credits, or what a refund reverses. Those are the
 * business decisions of the modules that own them — {@code CollectionPosting} makes
 * §9.5's split — and a ledger that also decided them would be a ledger nobody could
 * change the fee schedule without editing.
 *
 * <p><strong>It does not reverse anything.</strong> There is no {@code void} and no
 * {@code correct}. A correction is a new posting with the directions swapped, made by
 * whoever decided the correction was needed, and it is a separate transaction row
 * because it is a separate fact.
