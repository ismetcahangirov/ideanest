/**
 * The published API contract — §10.1's "REST with OpenAPI 3.1", and #136.
 *
 * <p><strong>Generated from the controllers, not written beside them.</strong> A
 * specification maintained by hand is a specification that describes what somebody
 * intended in the release they last edited it; this one cannot disagree with the service
 * because it is derived from the same mappings the service dispatches on. What is written
 * here is only what a scanner cannot infer: who publishes the API, where it lives, and how
 * a caller proves who they are.
 *
 * <p><strong>It is a build artefact and a reviewed file at the same time.</strong>
 * {@code OpenApiContractTests} exports the document to {@code apps/api/openapi.json} and
 * fails when the committed copy is out of date, so a change to a response body shows up in
 * a diff rather than in a client's runtime. That is the whole point of #136: the web and
 * mobile clients are generated from this file, so a field renamed without noticing becomes
 * a compile error in {@code @ideanest/api-client} rather than an {@code undefined} on
 * somebody's screen.
 *
 * <h2>Why the {@code -api} starter and no Swagger UI</h2>
 *
 * <p>Swagger UI is a web application with its own assets, its own CSP requirements, and its
 * own history of vulnerabilities, deployed inside the service that holds the payment
 * endpoints. What #136 asks for is a specification that produces typed clients, and that is
 * a JSON document. A browsable rendering belongs wherever the documentation is hosted, built
 * from the same committed file.
 *
 * <h2>The security scheme, and what it does and does not say</h2>
 *
 * <p>One scheme — §10.3's {@code Authorization: Bearer} — declared once and required
 * globally, because the overwhelming majority of the surface needs it and
 * {@code SecurityConfiguration} denies by default.
 *
 * <p><strong>The public reads are the exception, and the document does not mark them.</strong>
 * §10.2 lists them and {@code SecurityConfiguration} is where the rule actually lives;
 * teaching this file to enumerate them would be a second copy of that list, and the copy
 * that falls behind would tell a client that an endpoint needs a token it does not, or —
 * worse — that one does not need a token it does. A generated client sends the token when
 * it has one, which is correct for every endpoint here: the public reads accept an
 * anonymous caller and also accept a signed-in one, and several of them answer differently
 * because of it.
