/**
 * §21.2's hourly cache: {@code exchange-rate-refresh} — issue #327.
 *
 * <h2>Hourly, over a source that publishes daily</h2>
 *
 * Those are not in conflict, and it is worth saying which is which. §21.2 asks for the rates
 * to be "cached hourly"; the Central Bank of Azerbaijan publishes on working days. The hour
 * is therefore <strong>how quickly the platform notices a new publication</strong>, not how
 * often the number changes — and the practical value of it is the morning a new rate lands,
 * where an hourly pass has it inside the hour and a daily pass might not until tomorrow.
 *
 * <p>Eleven of the twelve daily passes therefore write nothing. That is the design and not
 * waste: {@link RateStore} asks one indexed question per currency, and the alternative — an
 * UPSERT — would keep the table at forty rows and lose the answer to "what was the official
 * rate the day this pledge was made".
 *
 * <h2>The fetch is outside the transaction, and the write is inside one</h2>
 *
 * {@link RateStore} is a separate bean rather than a {@code @Transactional} method here, and
 * the reason is mechanical rather than stylistic: a self-invoked annotated method does not
 * go through the proxy, so the annotation would have had no effect at all. Splitting them
 * also puts the boundary where it belongs — an HTTP call to a third party has no business
 * inside a database transaction, which is the same rule {@code CollectionRun} breaks
 * deliberately and explains at length.
 *
 * <h2>NOTHING IS ASKED FOR WHEN THE FEATURE IS OFF</h2>
 *
 * {@code ideanest.fx.enabled} is false by default, and the check is here rather than only at
 * the scheduler: turning the feature on means the service makes an outbound call to a third
 * party on a timer, and a deployment that has not decided to do that must not start because
 * it upgraded. A disabled deployment registers the job — so {@code /admin/health} lists it
 * and says it is not running — and the pass returns without a request.
 *
 * <h2>A source that cannot be reached is a WARN and not a failure</h2>
 *
 * Throwing is how a {@code ScheduledJob} reports that it could not run: the runner counts
 * the attempt, backs off exponentially and eventually marks the job {@code DEAD}. Applied
 * here that would mean a central bank's bad afternoon permanently stopping the refresh until
 * somebody reset a row by hand — for a feature whose failure mode is that an approximation
 * disappears from a screen.
 *
 * <p>So an outage is logged and the pass returns. What makes that safe rather than silent is
 * the age check on the other side: {@code ExchangeRates} stops offering a currency whose
 * newest rate is older than {@code ideanest.fx.max-age}, so a source that is genuinely gone
 * takes the feature off the screen within days rather than leaving a stale figure on it for
 * ever.
