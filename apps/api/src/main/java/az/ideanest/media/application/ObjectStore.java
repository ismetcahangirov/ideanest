/**
 * Where uploaded objects live — the media pipeline design of 2026-08-30.
 *
 * <h2>A port, so that the suite does not need a bucket</h2>
 *
 * <p>The implementation talks S3. This interface exists so that the tests for everything
 * above it — the state machine, the sweep, the idempotency of completion — run against a
 * directory on disk instead. A suite that needed object storage to assert that a row cannot
 * go {@code READY} without a key would be a suite nobody runs.
 *
 * <h2>Files rather than byte arrays, throughout</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every method that moves content moves it through a {@link Path}. A twenty-megabyte
 * upload as a {@code byte[]} is twenty megabytes of heap per concurrent request, and the
 * transcoder needs a file on disk anyway — libvips is a process, and a process is handed a
 * path.
