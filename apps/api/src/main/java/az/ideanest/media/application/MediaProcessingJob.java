/**
 * Turns uploaded objects into servable ones — the media pipeline design of 2026-08-30.
 *
 * <h2>A scheduled job rather than a thread pool</h2>
 *
 * <p>The design document proposed a bounded executor inside the API process, triggered by
 * the completion endpoint. This is a {@link ScheduledJob} instead, and the change is worth
 * the note because it is not a smaller version of the same idea — it is the machinery this
 * service already has. A job registered here is claimed on one replica, counted when it
 * fails and stopped when it has failed too often (#134); an executor would have been a
 * second concurrency mechanism with none of that, and one that loses its queue on restart.
 *
 * <p>What it costs is latency: an upload waits for the next tick rather than starting the
 * instant it completes. The schedule is therefore every five seconds rather than the minutes
 * or hours every other job in this service runs at — the person on the other end of this one
 * is watching a spinner.
 *
 * <h2>Why memory is bounded by the batch and not by a pool size</h2>
 *
 * <p>One image is decoded at a time, in a subprocess, by a library that streams. The batch
 * bounds how many files a tick touches; it does not put four bitmaps in this heap, because
 * none of them is ever in this heap. That is most of the argument for the native dependency
 * — see {@link ImageTranscoder}.
 *
 * <h2>Two kinds of failure, kept apart</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link MediaFailedException} is the creator's to act on and is recorded on the row.
 * {@link ObjectStoreUnavailableException} and {@link TranscoderUnavailableException} are
 * not: the row stays claimed and the pass throws, which is how {@code ScheduledJob} reports
 * a failed run — the runner counts the attempt, releases the lease and backs off. Recording
 * an unreachable bucket against somebody's photograph would tell them to send a different
 * one to fix an outage.
