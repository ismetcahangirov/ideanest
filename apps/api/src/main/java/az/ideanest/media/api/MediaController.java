/**
 * Uploading an image — the media pipeline design of 2026-08-30.
 *
 * <h2>Three calls, and none of them carries the file</h2>
 *
 * <p>Ask for an address, upload to it, say the upload finished. The bytes go from the
 * browser to the object store and never through this service, which is what makes a
 * twenty-megabyte cover cost this process nothing — a multipart endpoint would put that body
 * in a request thread, and there is no {@code spring.servlet.multipart} configuration in this
 * repository to size it with.
 *
 * <h2>Whose upload is never in the request</h2>
 *
 * <p>The access token's subject is the whole of the authorisation, exactly as on
 * {@code VerificationController}. There is no owner in the body and none in the path: an
 * identifier there would be the only field that mattered, and reading somebody else's upload
 * address is the entire attack.
 *
 * <h2>{@code no-store} on all three</h2>
 *
 * <p>The first answer contains a credential. The other two say what somebody's unfinished
 * campaign has in it. Neither is a document a shared cache should hold.
