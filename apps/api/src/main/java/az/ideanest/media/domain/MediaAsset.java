/**
 * One uploaded image, and where it has got to — the media pipeline design of 2026-08-30.
 *
 * <h2>The state machine is here, not in the service</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every transition is a method on this class and every one of them refuses to be called
 * out of order. The alternative — a setter for {@code status} and a service that calls them
 * in the right sequence — puts the rule in the caller, and there are three callers: the
 * upload endpoint, the completion endpoint, and the sweep. The third of those runs on a
 * lease after a restart, which is exactly the situation in which "the right sequence" stops
 * being obvious.
 *
 * <p>V61 holds the same promises as check constraints. That is deliberate duplication:
 * this class is one writer and a backfill is another, and a constraint is the one that
 * cannot be bypassed.
 *
 * <h2>What is not on this entity</h2>
 *
 * <p>No bytes, and no key for the raw upload. The raw object exists between the browser
 * writing it and the sweep replacing it, and its key is derived from the identifier rather
 * than stored — a column that is read inside one method and is wrong for the rest of the
 * row's life is a column that will eventually be read by something else.
 *
 * <p>No campaign either. A media row is created before anybody has said where the image
 * will be used, because the upload has to start before the creator has finished the form.
 * Attachment points the other way: {@code projects.cover_media_id} refers here.
