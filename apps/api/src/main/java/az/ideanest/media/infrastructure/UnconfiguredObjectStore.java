/**
 * The object store on a deployment that has not configured one — the media pipeline design
 * of 2026-08-30.
 *
 * <p>A bean rather than a null, so that nothing above it has to ask whether storage exists
 * before calling it. {@code MediaLibrary} asks {@link #isAvailable()} once, at the only
 * point where the answer changes what a caller is told; every other method here is
 * unreachable through that path and throws rather than returning something plausible.
 *
 * <p>Why this exists at all is in {@code MediaProperties}: there is no default bucket,
 * because a default would be a guess about somebody else's infrastructure, and a service
 * that refused to start without one would trade a hundred working endpoints for one.
