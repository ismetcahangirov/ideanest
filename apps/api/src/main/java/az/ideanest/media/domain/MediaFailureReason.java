 * <p>The column holds one of these names and nothing else. A message in a column is a
 * message that cannot be translated, and this one is shown to a creator in the campaign
 * editor in their own language — so the words live in the message catalogue with every
 * other string a creator reads, and the database holds the fact.
 *
 * <p>Each of these is also a failure the creator can do something about, which is the test
 * for whether a distinction is worth making. "The storage bucket rejected the request" is
 * not here: it is not their fault, it is transient, and the row stays claimed so the next
 * pass tries again.
