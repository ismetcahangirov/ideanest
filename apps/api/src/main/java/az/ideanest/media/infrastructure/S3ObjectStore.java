/**
 * The object store, over S3 — the media pipeline design of 2026-08-30.
 *
 * <h2>Two clients, and they are not interchangeable</h2>
 *
 * <p>An {@link S3Client} for the reads and writes this service performs, and an
 * {@link S3Presigner} for the addresses it hands to a browser. They are separate objects in
 * the SDK because presigning produces a URL without making a request, and the presigner has
 * to be built against the address the <em>browser</em> will reach — which on a deployment
 * behind a private endpoint is not the one this service uses.
 *
 * <h2>Why every failure here is {@link ObjectStoreUnavailableException}</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because none of them is the creator's. A bucket that refuses a request, a network that
 * drops, a credential that expired: recording any of them against somebody's upload would
 * tell them their photograph was the problem and invite them to send another one, forever.
 * The sweep leaves the row claimed and lets the scheduler back off instead.
 *
 * <p>The single exception is a key that is not there, which is reported as an absent file
 * rather than as an outage — see {@link #download}.
