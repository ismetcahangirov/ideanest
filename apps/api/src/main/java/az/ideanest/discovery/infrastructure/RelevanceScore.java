/**
 * §11.2's composite, as one {@code numeric} expression.
 *
 * <h2>What "normalise" normalises against, and why it cannot be the result set</h2>
 *
 * <p>§11.2 says {@code normalise(…)} and does not say against what. There are two
 * readings and only one of them is implementable here.
 *
 * <p><strong>Against the current result set</strong> — divide each campaign's raw value
 * by the largest in the matching set, so the best campaign on the page scores 1 — is
 * the reading that gives well-spread scores. It is unavailable, and not for a reason of
 * effort. The feed is keyset-paged (D-04, {@code DiscoveryCursor}): page two is a
 * different {@code WHERE} clause over a different set of rows, so its maximum is a
 * different number, so every score is on a different scale from page one's, so the
 * cursor's key means nothing on the page it is replayed against. The scroll would
 * duplicate and drop cards at every boundary. It would also cost a second full pass to
 * find the maximum before the first row could be scored, which §20's 300ms does not
 * have.
 *
 * <p><strong>Against a fixed scale</strong> is therefore what this is. Every term is a
 * closed-form function of one row and nothing else, mapping into {@code [0, 1]} with
 * constants that live in this file. Two campaigns score the same whether they are
 * compared on page one, page nine, or in two different queries a week apart — which is
 * also what makes the moderator diagnostic worth reading, because a per-term
 * contribution that depended on who else matched would explain nothing.
 *
 * <p>The cost is stated rather than hidden: a fixed scale cannot adapt. If every
 * campaign on the platform sits at 4% of its goal, the completion term is near zero for
 * all of them and stops separating anything. That is a tuning problem — the weights are
 * data precisely so it can be answered by moving a number — and it is a far smaller
 * problem than a scroll that loses cards.
 *
 * <h2>Where the money boundary is</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code pledged_amount} and {@code goal_amount} are {@code numeric} in the database
 * and {@code BigDecimal} in Java, and <strong>they never become a double anywhere in
 * here</strong>. The completion term is a ratio of two of them, and a ratio for ranking
 * is not money — nobody is paid it — so it would be permissible to compute it in double
 * precision. It is not computed that way, for a different reason: this expression is the
 * keyset cursor's sort key, and the keyset predicate compares it for <em>exact
 * equality</em>. Two evaluations of a float expression that rounded differently would
 * make a scroll skip a row, which is the same hazard, and the same fix, as
 * {@code PostgresSearchService.POPULARITY_SCORE}. Everything below is {@code numeric},
 * every term is rounded to six places, and the sum is rounded again.
 *
 * <p>The rule that follows from that, and the answer to "where is the boundary": the
 * amounts feeding a ratio must not round through a float <em>first</em>. They do not —
 * the ratio is formed inside PostgreSQL out of the stored {@code numeric} columns, and
 * the only thing that crosses into Java is the finished score.
 *
 * <h2>What this costs per row</h2>
 *
 * <p>Four multiplications, three divisions, one {@code floor}, one hashed set
 * membership, and one {@code ts_rank} when there is a query — no {@code power}, no
 * {@code exp}, no {@code ln}. That is deliberate and it is measured elsewhere:
 * {@code POPULARITY_SCORE} carries the note that {@code numeric_power} with a fractional
 * exponent cost 230ms of a 300ms budget at twenty thousand campaigns, because it goes
 * through {@code ln} and {@code exp} at full numeric precision. The obvious sigmoid —
 * the logistic {@code 1/(1+exp(-k(x-x₀)))} — is exactly that function, so it is not the
 * sigmoid used here. See {@link #completion()}.

     * §11.2's {@code w3}: the completion sigmoid, saturating at the goal.
     *
     * <p>The curve is the Hill function {@code c^k / (c^k + m^k)} with {@code m = 1} —
     * the midpoint at <strong>exactly the goal</strong>, which is what §11.2's
     * "saturating at the goal" asks for — and {@code k = 2}. Written over the raw
     * amounts, {@code c = pledged / goal} cancels and it becomes
     * {@code pledged² / (pledged² + goal²)}: <strong>no division by the goal at
     * all</strong>, which is also why the zero-goal case below is a guard rather than an
     * arithmetic accident waiting to happen. There is no constant to change — the
     * exponent is a squaring and the midpoint is the goal itself — so a different curve
     * is a different expression, which is the honest amount of ceremony for a change
     * that moves every campaign on the platform.
     *
     * <p><strong>Why this shape rather than the logistic.</strong> It is a sigmoid by
     * every property that matters here — monotone, bounded in {@code [0, 1)}, half at
     * the midpoint, saturating above it — and it is two multiplications, an addition and
     * a division of {@code numeric}s, exact and cheap. The logistic
     * {@code 1/(1+exp(-k(x-x₀)))} needs {@code exp}, which is the function
     * {@code POPULARITY_SCORE} measured at sixteen microseconds a row and removed.

     * <p>{@code k = 1} barely saturates — a campaign at five times its goal still gains
     * from every further pledge, which is the runaway §4.3 avoids by not defaulting to
     * an amount sort. {@code k = 4} throws away the range discovery is actually for:
     * everything under half funded scores below 0.06 and is indistinguishable from
     * nothing, so the term stops separating exactly the campaigns that most need
     * circulating. {@code k = 2} keeps the below-goal range readable and still flattens
     * hard above it.
     *
     * <p><strong>The three arithmetic edges, none of which can divide by zero or produce
     * a NaN.</strong> A campaign in {@code PRELAUNCH} has no goal, and a campaign that
     * has not asked for anything has not got 100% of the way to it, so a null goal is
     * zero rather than one. A goal of zero is impossible —
     * {@code projects_goal_is_positive} — and is guarded anyway, because a guard that
     * depends on a constraint in another migration is a guard that stops working when
     * that migration is edited. And a campaign at zero pledged short-circuits to zero,
     * which the formula would give anyway; it is written out so that the {@code 0/0}
     * case is visibly impossible rather than merely unreachable.
     *
     * <p>There is no upper guard, and there deliberately is not one: a campaign at 400%
     * of its goal scores 0.941 and a campaign at 4000% scores 0.9994, because the curve
     * saturates. That is the whole reason §11.2 asks for a sigmoid rather than a ratio —
