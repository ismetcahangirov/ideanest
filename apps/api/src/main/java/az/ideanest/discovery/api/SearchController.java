/**
 * Searching campaigns, and completing what is being typed. §10.2's
 * {@code GET /v1/search} and {@code GET /v1/search/suggest}.
 *
 * <h2>Why {@code /v1/search} is an alias over the discovery query and not its own
 * thing</h2>
 *
 * <p>§10.2 lists it as a separate route, so it exists as one. What it is
 * <em>not</em> is a separate implementation: it takes the same parameters, binds
 * them with the same binder, runs the same {@link SearchService#search}, and
 * answers with the same {@code Feed}. That is deliberate, and the alternative is
 * the bug. Every filter, every sort, the keyset cursor, and the facet counts have
 * to compose with free text — §4.3 offers all of them on the search results page
 * too — so a second endpoint with a query object of its own would be a second
 * implementation of the whole of discovery, differing from the first by whichever
 * filter somebody forgot. It would also mean two cursor encodings, and a client
 * that paged from one endpoint into the other would be told its cursor was forged.
 *
 * <p><strong>The one difference is that {@code q} is required.</strong>
 * {@code /v1/discover} without {@code q} is the browse feed, which is the whole
 * point of it; {@code /v1/search} without {@code q} is a search for nothing, which
 * no interface produces and which — answered with a page of arbitrary campaigns —
 * would look exactly like a search that had worked. It is refused with the same
 * RFC 9457 shape as any other bad parameter.
 *
 * <p>The second, quieter difference is the default order: {@code DiscoveryQuery}
 * resolves an unstated sort to {@code best_match} when there is text, so this
 * endpoint opens on relevance and {@code /v1/discover} opens on newest, without
 * either of them having to say so.
 *
 * <p><strong>There is no {@code /v1/search/facets}.</strong> §10.2 does not list one
 * and none is needed: {@code /v1/discover/facets} takes {@code q} like every other
 * parameter and counts the same narrowed set, so the search page's filter panel is
 * one request to an endpoint that already exists rather than a second copy of the
 * facet query maintained beside the first.
 *
 * <h2>Caching</h2>
 *
 * <p>Same conventions as {@code /v1/discover} (§10.3), same reasoning, same code —
 * see {@link PublicReads}. A search response holds nothing belonging to a person,
 * so it is {@code Cache-Control: public}; it varies with {@code Accept-Language}
 * because the facet labels and the suggestion labels do.
 *
 * <h2>Rate limiting</h2>
 *
 * <p>§17.3's "search 60/min", per address. {@code /v1/search} spends the same budget
 * as {@code /v1/discover} and autocomplete spends a larger one of its own; {@link
 * PublicReadLimits} says why.
