/**
 * Curating: the only way anything in {@code collections} is ever written.
 *
 * <h2>Who may</h2>
 *
 * <p>§3.2 grants "apply an editorial badge" to moderators and admins and to nobody
 * else, and every method here is that action or a step towards it — adding a campaign
 * to a badge-granting list <em>is</em> applying a badge. There is still no role model
 * in the schema or in the access token (§10.2 says so, and epic #100 owns it), so the
 * check is {@link PlatformStaff}, which #295 turned from one configured list of addresses into
 * moderation endpoints use, empty by default, failing closed.
 *
 * <p><strong>Reused rather than reinvented.</strong> A second directory — a
 * {@code ideanest.discovery.curation.curator-emails} beside the moderation one — would
 * be a second thing epic #100 has to find and delete, and a deployment could configure
 * one and forget the other. The cost is that a deployment cannot yet let somebody
 * curate without also letting them moderate, which is a distinction §3.2 does not draw
 * either: both actions belong to the same two roles.
 *
 * <p>The check runs before anything is loaded, so a caller who is not staff learns
 * nothing about which collections exist — the same shape, and the same reasoning, as
 * {@code ProjectAccess.requireModeratable}.
 *
 * <h2>What is recorded</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every method that changes anything writes exactly one {@code curation_events}
 * row, in the same transaction as the change. That is CLAUDE.md's audit rule and it is
 * why the repository's mutations and its {@link CollectionRepository#record} are only
 * ever called from here: a write that succeeded while its audit row was rolled back
 * would be an editorial decision with nobody's name on it.
 *
 * <p>An action that changes nothing writes nothing. Adding a campaign that is already
 * in the list and removing one that is not are both no-ops, and an audit trail that
 * records attempts rather than decisions is one nobody can read.
