 * worked is what stopped either issue from having to widen this enum, and what let a
 * client discover the vocabulary before the features landed — each of them switched
 * on by a constant appearing in {@code PostgresSearchService.capabilities()} and
 * nothing else changing here. See {@link DiscoveryCapability}.
 *
 * <p><strong>Every order is total.</strong> Each carries a tiebreaker of
 * {@code id ASC} on top of its sort key, and nothing else would be correct: a
 * keyset cursor over a non-total order duplicates and drops rows at every page
 * boundary where two campaigns share a key, and on this platform thousands of
 * campaigns share a {@code pledged_amount} of zero.

     * <p><strong>Why a sort of its own rather than "the order used when q is

     * resolves an unstated sort to this one exactly when there is text to rank by —
     * but the cursor carries the sort it was issued for and the fingerprint hashes

     * {@code sort=newest} switch back.

     * second scoring expression beside this one, not a replacement for it: the
     * §11.2 composite has a text term, and this is the text term. Nothing about
     * this constant, its cursor encoding, or its index has to change for that.
     *
     * <p>Requires {@link DiscoveryCapability#FULL_TEXT}, because a text score
     * needs a search vector. A query that names it without a {@code q} has nothing

     * are changed without a deployment, which is what §11.2 asks for and what makes
     * ranking measurable rather than arguable.
     *
     * <p><strong>Three of §11.2's eight terms run; five are inert and say so.</strong>
     * Completion, the editorial badge and recency decay have data. Both 48-hour
     * velocities do not — {@code pledged_amount} and {@code backers_count} are running
     * totals with no history behind them (epic #50) — and neither do view-to-pledge
     * conversion (#95), personalisation (D-07), or the spam signal (#108). Their weight
     * rows exist, the moderator diagnostic reports them contributing nothing, and V15
     * refuses to let one be switched on until something computes it.
     *
     * <p><strong>It contains {@link #BEST_MATCH} rather than replacing it.</strong> The
     * composite's text term is the identical {@code ts_rank} expression, which is what
     * #43 said would happen. The two orders remain different orders and the difference
     * is which question is being asked: {@code best_match} is "how well does this match
     * the words I typed", and this is "what should I be shown", of which the text match
     * is one term among several.
     *
     * <p><strong>An unstated sort still resolves to {@link #DEFAULT} or
     * {@link #DEFAULT_WITH_TEXT}, and this is deliberately not either.</strong> A
     * merged web client (`apps/web/src/lib/discovery/filters.ts`) resolves an absent
     * sort the same way and shows the reader which order is in force; making relevance
     * the default here would silently change what every existing link means and would
     * make that control lie. It is opt-in — {@code ?sort=relevance} — until somebody
     * has measured it against the two defaults, which is exactly what the tunable
     * weights and the diagnostic exist to make possible.
     *
     * <p><strong>The cursor pins more than #42's.</strong> #42 pinned the decay clock so
     * the score could not move on its own between pages; this additionally binds the
     * cursor to a digest of the weights, so a tuning change mid-scroll is refused and
     * restarted rather than silently reshuffling the feed under the reader. What no
     * cursor can pin is {@code pledged_amount}, so the surviving guarantee is the one
     * {@code DiscoveryCursor} states for every order over a mutable column: a row that
     * moves is seen once or not at all, and no row that stayed still is duplicated or
     * dropped.
     *
     * <p>Like {@link #POPULARITY}, <strong>no index serves it</strong> — the key is an
     * expression over several columns, a request parameter, and a configuration — so
     * PostgreSQL sorts the matching rows. At §11.1's tier-1 ceiling that is a sort of a
     * few thousand rows; past it, this is one of the things that moves to the engine.

     * §20's thousand requests a second reachable — so there is no caller to read a

     * {@code DiscoveryCapability.FILTER_RECOMMENDED} explains at length. The origin is
     * quantised to about a kilometre before it reaches anything; see
     * {@code LocationFilter.Proximity}, where the reasoning is privacy rather than
     * arithmetic.
     *
     * <p><strong>An unstated origin is refused, not resolved to another order.</strong>
     * {@link #BEST_MATCH} without {@code q} falls back to {@link #DEFAULT} because a
     * text score over no text is zero for every campaign and the request has exactly

     * a "near me" control that quietly meant "newest" is the failure
     * {@link DiscoveryCapability} exists to prevent. {@code DiscoveryQueryBinder}
     * refuses it.
     *
     * <p><strong>A campaign with no location sorts last, and is not excluded.</strong>
     * §4.3 lists Near me under sorts and proximity under the Location <em>filter</em>:
     * they are two controls and this is the sort. A sort that dropped rows would take a
     * reader who switched from newest to near-me and silently remove most of the
     * platform from their feed, which is the same failure as a filter that is accepted
     * and ignored, wearing an order's clothes. Nulls last, like {@link #NEWEST} and
     * {@link #ENDING_SOON}, and the cursor has the null-tail branch those two have. A
     * <em>radius</em> is a filter and does exclude them — a campaign whose location is
     * unknown cannot be shown to be within any distance of anywhere.
     *
     * <p><strong>The key cannot move, which makes this the easiest cursor in the
     * module.</strong> Neither the origin (pinned in the fingerprint) nor a city
     * centroid changes while somebody scrolls, so unlike {@code most_funded},
     * {@code popularity} and {@code relevance} — all of which read {@code pledged_amount}
     * — a near-me feed has no rows moving underneath it at all. What the cursor still
     * has to pin is the origin itself, and it does: see
     * {@code LocationFilter.Proximity.canonical}.
     *
     * <p><strong>Like {@link #POPULARITY}, no index serves the order</strong>, and for a
     * better reason than that one. The key is an expression over a joined table and a
     * request parameter, so it is not indexable; but distance is a property of a
     * <em>location</em> rather than of a campaign, and there are eighteen of those, so
     * what PostgreSQL actually does is compute a handful of distances and sort the
     * matching campaigns by a hash-joined number. V16's comment has the measurement and
     * the reason no GiST index is shipped with it.
