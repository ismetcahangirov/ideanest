/**
 * Tier 1 of §11.1: discovery served by PostgreSQL.
 *
 * <p><strong>Raw SQL, not the project module's repositories.</strong> Two reasons,
 * and they agree. {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} forbids reaching into
 * {@code project.infrastructure}; and a feed of a hundred cards loaded as JPA
 * entities is a hundred managed objects with their associations, for a projection
 * that uses fourteen columns. §20 asks for a thousand requests a second at p99 under
 * 300ms, and a read model with its own query is the only shape that gets there.
 *
 * <h2>What this can and cannot do</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #capabilities()} holds free text (#43), curation (#48), and the composite
 * ranking (#44). Every other option §4.3 describes that needs something absent — a
 * {@code locations} table, a saved table, a per-caller signal — is refused by the caller
 * with a problem detail naming its issue, rather than accepted and dropped. See
 * {@link DiscoveryCapability}.
 *
 * <h2>Relevance, in three live terms out of eight</h2>
 *
 * <p>§11.2's composite is served under {@link DiscoverySort#RELEVANCE}, and
 * <strong>five of its eight terms have no data source in this schema</strong>: both
 * velocities need a pledge ledger, conversion needs analytics, personalisation needs a
 * caller, and the spam signal needs fraud detection. Those terms are seeded inert in
 * V15 and say what is blocking them; what actually runs is completion, the editorial
 * badge, recency, and the text term #43 left for it. {@code RelevanceScore} holds the
 * arithmetic and the reasoning; the weights are rows in {@code ranking_weights} and are
 * changed without a deployment, which is what §11.2 requires and why they are not
 * constants in this file.
 *
 * <h2>Free text, in two tiers</h2>
 *
 * <p>D-01 is a {@code tsvector} match against {@code projects.search_vector} (V13),
 * over the title, blurb, creator name and story prose, all folded by §11.3 in the
 * database so that the index and the query cannot disagree about what
 * {@code seçənək} means. D-03 — misspelling tolerance — is a second tier over
 * trigram similarity of the title, and it engages <strong>only when the first tier
 * matches nothing at all</strong>: see {@link #exactTierMatches}. An exact match
 * therefore always outranks a fuzzy one, because a fuzzy result set is only ever
 * produced when there is no exact one.
 *
 * <p>Text composes with every filter, every sort, the keyset cursor, and the facet
 * counts, because it is one more AND'd predicate over the same table and nothing
 * else about the query changes. The one thing it adds is an order —
 * {@link DiscoverySort#BEST_MATCH} — whose key is a {@code numeric} rounded to six
 * places, for the reason {@link #POPULARITY_SCORE} is rounded.
 *
 * <h2>What tier 2 would have to satisfy</h2>
 *
 * <p>The list is on {@link SearchService}, where a second implementer will read it.
 * The two that this class earns rather than declares are worth repeating here:
 * visibility is a predicate on a live table, so a campaign suspended a second ago is
 * already invisible — an external index has to be told; and money is
 * {@code numeric} throughout, so a band boundary is exact rather than nearly.

     * would give a different response body to two requests a millisecond apart, which
     * defeats the ETag entirely: every conditional request would revalidate to a 200
     * and the cache would buy nothing on the one sort most likely to be a landing
     * page. Truncating to the cache window makes the first page byte-identical for
     * everybody inside it.
     *
     * <p>It also has to be truncated for a second reason. The cursor pins this instant
     * so that page two scores the same campaigns the same way as page one; an instant
     * with millisecond resolution would make every scroll a unique cache key.

     * exponent of 1.5 is the gravity constant this shape of ranking is usually written
     * with — steep enough that a month-old campaign does not sit on the front page for
     * ever, shallow enough that a campaign has more than a day to be noticed.

     * <p>{@code numeric} rather than {@code double precision} at every step. The value
     * is compared for exact equality by the keyset predicate, and a float that two
     * evaluations of the same expression round differently would make a scroll skip a
     * row. Rounding to six places is what makes that equality reliable rather than
     * merely likely.
     *
     * <p><strong>{@code a * sqrt(a)} rather than {@code power(a, 1.5)}, and the age in
     * whole hours.</strong> They are the same number and they are not the same cost:
     * {@code numeric_power} with a fractional exponent goes through {@code ln} and
     * {@code exp} at full numeric precision, which measured at roughly sixteen
     * microseconds per row — and the score is projected for every matching row before
     * the sort, so at twenty thousand campaigns that alone was 230ms of a 300ms budget
     * (§20). {@code sqrt} is Newton's method on a numeric and is an order of magnitude
     * cheaper, and flooring the age to an hour keeps its input a small integer instead
     * of a fraction with fifteen decimal places. Both stay exact, which
     * {@code double precision} would not.
     *
     * <p>Flooring the age also makes the score change hourly rather than continuously,
     * which is the right granularity for something described as decay and is one less
     * reason for two requests in one cache window to differ.
     *
     * <p>A campaign that never launched scores zero rather than null, so the order has
     * no null branch to handle.

     * with the others, so the obvious implementation is one query per dimension —
     * seven round trips for one panel. Instead a single {@code base} CTE scans the

     * saying whether it matches that dimension's filter. Every facet is then an
     * aggregate over that one materialised set, requiring all the flags except its
     * own, and the seven aggregates are stitched together with {@code UNION ALL} into
     * one statement.
     *
     * <p><strong>Cost.</strong> One pass over the publicly visible campaigns to build
     * {@code base}, plus one hash aggregate per dimension over it, plus one join to
     * {@code project_tags} for the tag facet. Everything the aggregates join against —
     * fifteen categories, a hundred and five subcategories, five bands twice, five
     * statuses — is tiny and static. {@code MATERIALIZED} is explicit rather than left
     * to the planner, because the CTE is referenced seven times and inlining it would
     * turn one scan into seven.
     *
     * <p><strong>Where the ceiling is.</strong> {@code base} is O(public campaigns)
     * and no index removes that: a count over every matching row has to touch every
     * matching row. The partial covering index in V12 keeps it an index-only scan, so
     * the constant is small, but the shape is linear. At §11.1's tier-1 ceiling of
     * roughly ten thousand campaigns this is a few milliseconds. The first thing to do
     * when it stops being is <em>not</em> another index — it is to cache the panel per
     * filter set, because a filter panel changes far less often than a feed page. The
     * second is tier 2, which is exactly the trigger §11.1 names: "or when faceting
     * becomes complex".
     *
     * <p><strong>The one thing that is not in this query</strong> is the localised
     * name of each taxon. Those come from {@link Taxonomy}, which owns the

     * What the reader might mean, from three sources at once.
     *
     * <h2>How a fragment matches</h2>
     *
     * <p>Substring of the folded form, with the prefix matches first. Substring
     * rather than prefix alone because a two-word title is usually remembered by its
     * second word — somebody typing "oyun" is looking for "Seçənək masa oyunu" — and
     * prefix-first because a fragment that starts a name is far more likely to be
     * what was meant than one that appears in the middle of it.
     *
     * <p>{@code LIKE} over {@code ideanest_fold(title)} rather than the
     * {@code tsvector}: a tsvector holds whole lexemes, so "seç" matches nothing in
     * it, and matching a partial word is the entire job here. The trigram index V13
     * creates on that expression is what makes the wildcard-leading pattern an index
     * scan rather than a table scan.
     *
     * <h2>How the three sources share the list</h2>
     *
     * <p>Round robin, in the order category, subcategory, tag, campaign, until the
     * limit is reached. Not concatenation: a fragment matching six categories would
     * otherwise fill a list of ten before a single campaign appeared, and the reader
     * typing the name of a campaign would be shown everything except it. Round robin
     * guarantees every kind that matched at all is represented, which is what makes
     * {@link Suggestion.Kind} worth carrying.
     *
     * <p>The taxonomy is matched in memory rather than in SQL. It is fifteen
     * categories and about a hundred subcategories, it is already loaded per request
     * for the facet labels, and {@link Taxonomy} owns the requested-locale → az →
     * slug fallback chain — reimplementing that chain in a {@code LIKE} over
     * {@code category_translations} would be a second answer to "what is this
     * category called".
