/**
 * The five words a backer uses for where a campaign is, and the internal states
 * each of them covers.
 *
 * <p>§4.3 offers five status filters. §6.1 has sixteen states. They are not the
 * same vocabulary and must not be conflated: a backer asking for "successful"
 * means "it made its goal", which is true of a campaign that is still collecting,
 * one that is shipping, and one that finished two years ago. Mapping the two is
 * therefore a product decision, and this enum is the one place it is written down.
 *
 * <p><strong>States are strings here, not {@code ProjectState}.</strong> Discovery
 * may not import {@code project.domain} — {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} fails the
 * build for it — and this module reads {@code projects.state} as text out of its
 * own SQL anyway. {@code DiscoveryStatusTests} imports both and fails if a name
 * here is not a state there, or if the sixteen are not partitioned exactly once
 * into {@link #PUBLIC_STATES} and {@link #HIDDEN_STATES}.
