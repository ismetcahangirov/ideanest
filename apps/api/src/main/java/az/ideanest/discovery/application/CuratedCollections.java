/**
 * Reading curated collections. D-08's landing pages, and §4.3's Programmes control.
 *
 * <p><strong>A second interface beside {@link SearchService} rather than four more
 * methods on it.</strong> The two answer different questions. {@code SearchService}
 * is §11.1's substitution seam: everything on it is a query a dedicated search engine
 * would take over. Nothing here is. A collection is a short, curated, editorially
 * maintained list that lives in PostgreSQL whatever serves the feed, and folding it
 * into the seam would oblige a tier-2 implementer to reimplement the curation reads
 * in order to replace the search.
 *
 * <p><strong>Every method here answers only about collections the public may
 * see</strong> — published, and inside their display window. There is no argument for
 * "include the unpublished ones", so no caller can pass one by mistake; the admin
 * surface reads its own rows through its own repository. The consequence a caller has
 * to know about is that {@link #find} answers empty for a collection that exists and
 * is not published yet, which is what makes the endpoint answer 404 rather than 403 —
 * a 403 would confirm that a list somebody is still assembling exists.
 *
 * <p><strong>Membership is filtered again on read.</strong> A curator may add a
 * campaign that is later suspended, and the membership row stays — removing it would
 * rewrite the editorial history to say the campaign was never chosen. What changes is
 * that it stops being returned and stops being counted, by the same
 * {@code DiscoveryStatus.PUBLIC_STATES} predicate every other read in this module
 * applies.
