/**
 * Everything a caller asked discovery for, in one value.
 *
 * <p><strong>This is the input half of the §11.1 seam.</strong> Nothing on it is a
 * SQL fragment, a JDBC type, a Spring Data {@code Pageable}, or a column name, so an
 * implementation backed by a dedicated search engine reads the same object.
 *
 * <p><strong>Every filter composes with every other.</strong> The dimensions are
 * AND'd; within a dimension the rule depends on whether a campaign can hold one
 * value or several, and it is not a preference:
 *
 * <table>
 *   <caption>How multiple values within one dimension combine</caption>
 *   <tr><th>Dimension</th><th>Rule</th><th>Why</th></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Status</td><td>OR</td><td>a campaign is in one state</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Category, subcategory</td><td>OR</td><td>a campaign is filed in one place; AND would return nothing</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Completion, goal band, raised band</td><td>OR</td><td>the bands partition the line</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Programmes</td><td>OR</td><td>a campaign is in one open call; see below</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td><strong>Tags</strong></td><td><strong>AND</strong></td><td>a campaign carries several, and adding a tag is a refinement</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p><strong>Programmes are OR'd rather than AND'd, unlike tags, and the reason is
 * the same reason.</strong> A tag is something a creator says about their campaign
 * and several are true at once, so ticking a second one refines. A programme is a
 * list somebody was accepted into; a campaign is normally in one, and requiring
 * membership of two open calls at once would return nothing for almost every pair —
 * the same dead end the category dimension avoids by OR'ing.
 *
 * <p>Tags are the only genuine choice there, and AND is the answer because of what
 * the control looks like. Every other filter in this set narrows when a second value
 * is ticked; a tag list that widened would be the one control on the page that moves
 * the count in the other direction, and a backer who ticked "handmade" and "ceramics"
 * meant campaigns that are both. The cost is that two unrelated tags return nothing,
 * which is visible and self-correcting, rather than a hundred irrelevant cards, which
 * is not.
 *
 * <p><strong>Adding a field is additive.</strong> The builder exists so that #43,
 * #44, #47 and #48 each add one component and one setter without touching each
 * other's lines or every call site. The corresponding rule for behaviour is
 * {@link DiscoveryCapability}: a field that is representable and not yet servable is
 * refused loudly by {@link SearchService}, never ignored.
 *
 * @param text free-text query (D-01), as the reader typed it — <strong>unfolded</strong>,
 *     because §11.3's fold belongs to the index and the query has to be folded the
 *     same way the index was, which is the database's job. Makes the whole filter
 *     and pagination machinery reusable by {@code GET /v1/search} without a second
 *     query object; refused by any implementation that does not declare
 *     {@link DiscoveryCapability#FULL_TEXT}
 * @param statuses §4.3's five words; empty means every publicly visible state
 * @param categorySlugs primary category slugs; empty means any
 * @param subcategorySlugs subcategory slugs; empty means any. Independent of
 *     {@code categorySlugs} and AND'd with it, so "games, and subcategory tabletop"
 *     and "subcategory tabletop" are both expressible
 * @param tagSlugs folded tag slugs, AND'd. See the table above
 * @param programmeSlugs §4.3's Programmes filter: the slugs of the open calls a
 *     campaign may be part of, OR'd. <strong>#48.</strong> A slug naming no open call
 *     matches nothing, exactly as an unknown category slug does — it is content, not
 *     a closed vocabulary, so a stale link is an empty feed rather than a 400
 * @param goal the {@code goal_amount} dimension
 * @param raised the {@code pledged_amount} dimension
 * @param completion §4.3's five completion bands, OR'd
 * @param location country, city, proximity. <strong>Served (#47).</strong> Country
 *     and city are one dimension for faceting, as category and subcategory are; the
 *     origin is quantised on the way in and is part of {@link #fingerprint()}, which
 *     is what pins it to the cursor. See {@link LocationFilter}
 * @param showOnly saved, recommended, featured. <strong>Featured is served (#48);
 *     saved and recommended are still refused</strong>
 * @param sort one of §4.3's seven plus {@link DiscoverySort#BEST_MATCH}. When
 *     unstated it is {@link DiscoverySort#DEFAULT} while browsing and
 *     {@link DiscoverySort#DEFAULT_WITH_TEXT} while searching; the constructor
 *     resolves it, so this component is never null and the fingerprint and the
 *     cursor always name a real order
 * @param limit page size, already clamped into {@link #MIN_LIMIT}..{@link #MAX_LIMIT}
 * @param cursor where the previous page stopped, or null for the first page
 * @param locale the negotiated language, for facet labels. <strong>Deliberately not
 *     part of the fingerprint</strong> — switching language mid-scroll must not
 *     invalidate the cursor, because the order and the membership of the results do
 *     not depend on it
