/**
 * One campaign as a feed shows it — D-05: "image, title, creator, completion, days
 * left, badge".
 *
 * <p>Deliberately not the project page. A card carries what a grid renders and
 * nothing that costs a join nobody looks at: no story, no rewards, no tags, no
 * counts that would have to be aggregated per row. §20 asks for a thousand requests
 * a second at p99 under 300ms, and the shape of this record is most of what decides
 * whether that is achievable — a field added here is a field fetched for every card
 * on every page for everybody.
 *
 * <p><strong>Money is {@link Money}, and reaches the client as a string.</strong>
 * §10.3 and {@code CLAUDE.md}. {@link #completionPercent} is a {@code BigDecimal}
 * for the same reason: it is a ratio of two money values, and computing it as a
 * {@code double} would reintroduce the error the string exists to prevent, at the
 * one place a backer actually reads it.
 *
 * @param id the campaign
 * @param slug its half of {@code /projects/{creatorSlug}/{projectSlug}}
 * @param creatorSlug the other half
 * @param title as the creator wrote it
 * @param creator who is asking for the money
 * @param coverImage null while the campaign has none; §5.3 requires one to submit,
 *     and a {@code PRELAUNCH} teaser has not submitted
 * @param goal null on a campaign that has not set one — a {@code PRELAUNCH} row
 * @param pledged never null; the column defaults to zero
 * @param completionPercent null when there is no goal to be a percentage of
 * @param backersCount never null
 * @param daysLeft null when there is no deadline; zero once the deadline has passed
 * @param badge which of §4.3's five words describes this campaign, or null for a
 *     state no word covers — {@code CANCELED}
 * @param state the internal state, so a client can render something specific
 *     without this module having to invent a sixth word for it
