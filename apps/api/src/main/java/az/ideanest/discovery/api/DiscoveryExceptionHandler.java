/**
 * Discovery's own failures, as RFC 9457 problem details (§10.4).
 *
 * <p>Scoped to this module's controllers rather than applied globally, for the reason
 * {@code RewardExceptionHandler} gives: an advice that catches a broad type across the
 * whole service turns a bug somewhere else into a tidy 4xx and hides it. Both of them
 * are named, because {@code /v1/search} raises exactly the same three failures as
 * {@code /v1/discover} — it binds the same parameters and issues the same query — and
 * an advice that covered one would leave the other answering a bad cursor with a 500.
 *
 * <p>Every response carries a {@code code} as well as a status. All three failures
 * here are 400s and a client has to be able to tell them apart without matching on
 * prose — one means "start again from the first page", one means "stop sending this
 * parameter", and one means "fix the value".
