/**
 * Tuning the ranking: the only way {@code ranking_weights} is ever written.
 *
 * <h2>Who may</h2>
 *
 * <p><strong>Changing a weight is a privileged action, and by a wider margin than
 * curating.</strong> §3.2 makes applying an editorial badge a moderator action because
 * it directs the platform's attention at one campaign. A weight directs it at every
 * campaign, in every feed, for every reader, at once — moving {@code w4} from 0.15 to
 * 1.5 promotes the platform's own picks above everything else on it without touching a
 * single collection. CLAUDE.md requires every privileged action to be audited, and this
 * is the one where the question "who changed it, when, and why" is most likely to be
 * asked by somebody who is not on the team.
 *
 * <p>The check is {@link ModeratorDirectory} — the same configured list of addresses the
 * moderation endpoints and {@link CurationService} use, empty by default, failing
 * closed. Reused rather than reinvented for the reason {@code CurationService} gives: a
 * second directory is a second thing epic #100 has to find and delete, and a deployment
 * could configure one and forget the other. The cost is the same and is the same
 * distinction §3.2 does not draw either.
 *
 * <p>The check runs before anything is read, so a caller who is not staff learns nothing
 * about how the platform is tuned. That matters more here than it does for collections:
 * the weights are a description of how to rank highly, and a campaign that knew them
 * would know what to optimise.
 *
 * <h2>What is recorded</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every change writes exactly one {@code ranking_weight_changes} row, in the same
 * transaction, carrying the value before as well as the value after. A change that made
 * no difference — the same weight and the same flag — writes nothing and is not an
 * error: an audit trail that records attempts rather than decisions is one nobody can
 * read, which is {@code CurationService}'s rule and the same one.
 *
 * <p>The note is required on every change. Not decoration: §11.2's purpose is that
 * ranking be measured rather than argued about, and a weight moved with no stated
 * hypothesis is unmeasurable by construction — a year later the row is the only place
 * the reason still exists.
