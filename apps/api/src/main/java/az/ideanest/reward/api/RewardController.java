/**
 * A creator's reward tiers: writing them, ordering them, pricing their shipping, and
 * copying them.
 *
 * <p>Seven endpoints, one response type. {@link RewardResponse} is the creator's
 * projection and carries what no public response may — the reservation counts and the
 * secret token — which is why the campaign page's reward list is a different response
 * owned by a different issue.
 *
 * <p>Authorisation is not decided here. Every method passes the caller's identifier
 * down to {@code RewardAccess}, which finds the campaign and asks {@code ProjectAccess}:
 * one place, so that #38 widening it to collaborators changes one file.
 *
 * <p>A tier under somebody else's campaign is answered {@code 404 REWARD_NOT_FOUND},
 * identically to an identifier that never existed. See {@code RewardNotFoundException}:
 * a reward tier is a price on an unreleased product, and telling a stranger that one
 * exists is the disclosure a draft is private to prevent.
 *
 * <p><strong>No {@code Location} header on create or duplicate.</strong> There is no
 * single-tier read endpoint — the editor reads the campaign's list — and a header
 * pointing at a URL that answers 404 is worse than no header.
