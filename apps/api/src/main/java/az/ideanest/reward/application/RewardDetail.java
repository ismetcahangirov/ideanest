/**
 * A reward tier with everything that hangs off it.
 *
 * <p>Composition and shipping rates are separate tables and separate entities —
 * see {@code RewardTier} for why they are not mapped as associations — so something
 * has to carry them together from the service to the response. This does, and it is
 * assembled with one query per collection for a whole reward list rather than one
 * per tier.
 *
 * <p><strong>Two rate tables since #77</strong>, and both are carried: the
 * per-country rates V7 has always had, and the per-zone rates V37 added. They are
 * separate collections rather than one merged list because they are edited as two —
 * a creator removes Germany from the named list without touching what the EU zone
 * charges — and because merging them would have to decide the precedence in the
 * response, which is {@code ShippingRates}' decision and belongs where a quote is
 * built rather than where an editor is rendered.
 *
 * <p>Every endpoint in this module that returns a tier returns this, so a client
 * applies the same update to its state after a create, a patch, a duplicate, and a
 * shipping-rate replacement. An endpoint that answered with a thinner shape would
 * make a client's state depend on which request it happened to make last.
 *
 * @param locks what §5.3 has frozen on the campaign this tier belongs to, as
 *     {@link RewardAccess} already had to establish in order to authorise the
 *     request. It is carried through to the response rather than recomputed there,
 *     because the answer that reaches the client must be the one the service used —
 *     see {@code RewardResponse.pricingLocked} for what a client does with it, and
 *     #183 for what happened when there was nothing to do it with
