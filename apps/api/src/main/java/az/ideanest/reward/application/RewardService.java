/**
 * Reward tiers: writing them, composing them from items, ordering them, pricing
 * their shipping, and copying them.
 *
 * <p><strong>Validation is here as well as in the database.</strong> Every rule below
 * is also a check constraint in {@code V7}, for the reason {@code ItemService} gives.
 * The cross-field rules are checked once against the finished tier rather than field
 * by field, because a single patch may legitimately fix two at the same time — a body
 * that clears {@code isSecret} and sets {@code isFeatured} is a valid edit, and a
 * per-field check would accept or refuse it depending on which field it happened to
 * read first.
 *
 * <p><strong>What is not here.</strong>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Reservation.</strong> #51 owns it. Nothing in this class writes
 *       {@code claimed_quantity} or {@code reserved_quantity}; the entity does not
 *       expose them for writing and the columns are not insertable. What this
 *       migration and this service provide is the constraint that work will rely on.
 *   <li><strong>Which states freeze what.</strong> §5.3 makes a reward's price
 *       immutable once a campaign is live and permits a quantity to be raised but
 *       not lowered after that. <em>Whether</em> a campaign has reached that point is
 *       not decided here: it is one table, {@code ProjectEditLocks}, in the module
 *       that owns the campaign's state, and it arrives as {@code EditLocks} through
 *       {@link RewardAccess}. This service decides only what to do about the answer,
 *       which is a 409 naming the field. The floor a quantity may be lowered to
 *       <em>before</em> launch — claimed plus reserved — is a different rule and is
 *       still {@link #withinLimit}.
 * </ul>

     *       places away from a page that promised there were always more.
