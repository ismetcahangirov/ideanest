/**
 * A reward tier as the creator first describes it.
 *
 * <p>Plain values, for the reason {@link NewItem} gives: creation has nothing to
 * leave alone.
 *
 * @param price required. Unlike the campaign's goal, which a draft may be without,
 *     a tier with no price is not something a backer can select — it would have to
 *     be excluded from every list and every total, which is a state worth not having
 * @param shippingType null means {@link ShippingType#NONE}. A creator who has not
 *     said how a reward is delivered has not promised to ship it anywhere, and
 *     defaulting to shipping would ask a backer for an address nobody intended to use
 * @param items the composition. Empty is legal and common at this point: a creator
 *     writes the tier, then builds the items it contains
