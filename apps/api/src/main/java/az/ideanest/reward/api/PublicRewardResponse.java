/**
 * A reward tier as a backer sees it.
 *
 * <p>The public counterpart of {@link RewardResponse}, and a separate type because
 * the difference between them is the feature. What is <strong>absent</strong> here
 * carries as much of the design as what is present:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>{@code secretToken}.</strong> The link is the creator's to hand out.
 *       A public list that echoed it back would make every secret tier reachable by
 *       anyone who read one response, which is the whole of PL-15 undone.
 *   <li><strong>{@code claimedQuantity} and {@code reservedQuantity}.</strong> How
 *       many people are in a campaign's checkout right now is a commercial fact about
 *       the creator, and a backer needs only the number this tier can still sell.
 *       {@code remainingQuantity} is that number and is derived from all three.
 *   <li><strong>{@code isSecret}.</strong> A secret tier the caller has unlocked is
 *       returned as an ordinary one. A flag would tell whoever received the link
 *       nothing they did not know, and its <em>absence</em> from the unfiltered list
 *       is what keeps a client from rendering "1 hidden reward".
 *   <li><strong>{@code version}, {@code pricingLocked}, {@code sortOrder}, the
 *       timestamps, and the availability window.</strong> Editor machinery. The order
 *       is expressed by the order of the array, and a tier outside its window is not
 *       in the array at all, so nothing here has to be re-derived by a client.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Nulls are written out</strong>, for a stronger reason than
 * {@link RewardResponse}'s. {@code limitQuantity} and {@code remainingQuantity} are
 * null exactly when the tier is unlimited — the application's Jackson omits nulls by
 * default, and a client that could not tell "unlimited" from "the server did not say"
 * would have to guess, on the one field that decides whether a backer is shown "3
 * left".
 *
 * @param price the tier's own, with the campaign's currency on it. §10.3: the amount
 *     is a string on the wire
 * @param estimatedDelivery a date, or null. A month is what a creator can honestly
 *     promise; see {@code RewardTier}
 * @param limitQuantity null means unlimited
 * @param remainingQuantity {@code limitQuantity} minus what is claimed and reserved,
 *     or null when unlimited. PL-01's live stock check reads this, and it is
 *     {@code RewardTier#getRemainingQuantity()} rather than arithmetic repeated here:
 *     a second implementation of one subtraction is a second chance to oversell
 * @param items what is in the tier, described. No identifiers — see
 *     {@code PublicRewardCatalogue}
 * @param shippingRates per destination, so a client can quote PL-05's shipping charge
 *     before the backer reaches checkout. Empty when the tier is not shipped
