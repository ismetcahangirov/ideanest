/**
 * What a backer selects and pays for.
 *
 * <p><strong>Stock is read here and never written.</strong>
 * {@link #getClaimedQuantity()} and {@link #getReservedQuantity()} are mapped as
 * non-insertable and non-updatable columns: the pledge module (epic #50) and
 * reservation (#51) own them, and the campaign editor must not be able to move
 * them. A tier that could edit its own claimed count is a tier that can decide it
 * still has stock — and the database's
 * {@code reward_tiers_stock_is_within_the_limit} constraint would then be
 * enforcing an invariant against a number the editor had adjusted to fit.
 *
 * <p>The consequence is that a duplicate cannot copy them, which is the correct
 * behaviour and is not a special case anywhere: {@link #duplicateAt(int)} makes a
 * row that the database defaults to zero.
 *
 * <p>{@link Version} rather than a pessimistic lock. Two writers to one tier are
 * ordinary — the creator editing the description while a checkout reserves a place
 * — and unlike a state transition the loser has something useful to do, which is
 * re-read and retry. A row lock would instead make a backer's checkout wait on a
 * creator's autosave.
 *
 * <p>Money is {@link BigDecimal} against {@code numeric(14,2)}. This is the number
 * a card is charged.
