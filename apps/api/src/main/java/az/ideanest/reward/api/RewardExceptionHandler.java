/**
 * The reward module's own failures, as RFC 9457 problem details.
 *
 * <p>Scoped to this module's two controllers rather than applied globally, for the
 * reason {@code ProjectExceptionHandler} gives: an advice that catches a broad type
 * across the whole service turns a bug somewhere else into a tidy 4xx and hides it.
 * Listed separately from the project module's advice, rather than added to its
 * {@code assignableTypes}, because several sibling issues are in flight and that one
 * line is the file they would all conflict in.
 *
 * <p>Every response carries a {@code code} as well as a status, per §10.4. The status
 * tells a client how to behave; the code tells it what happened, and it is what a client
 * branches on. Three different 409s that cannot be told apart would force clients to
 * match on prose.
