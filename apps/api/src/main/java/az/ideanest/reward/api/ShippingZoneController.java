/**
 * §4.8's PM-13 over HTTP: the regions a campaign ships to.
 *
 * <p>On the <strong>campaign</strong> and not on a tier, unlike
 * {@code PUT /v1/rewards/{id}/shipping-rules}. A region is a fact about the carrier
 * agreement the creator negotiated, so every tier prices the same regions and only
 * the amounts differ; putting the membership on a tier would mean re-entering
 * twenty-seven countries for each of them, which is the work this feature exists to
 * remove.
 *
 * <p>Both endpoints require a bearer token by falling through to
 * {@code SecurityConfiguration}'s catch-all, and both require {@code EDIT_REWARDS},
 * which {@code ShippingZoneService} enforces.
 *
 * <p><strong>No rate limiter.</strong> This is an authenticated write on the
 * creator's own campaign, bounded by {@code ShippingZoneService}'s two ceilings and
 * reaching nobody but the caller — the opposite of {@code CampaignMessageController},
 * where one request reaches every backer.
