/**
 * A partial edit of a reward tier, with JSON Merge-Patch semantics (RFC 7396).
 *
 * <p>Every field is a {@link Patched}, so a body carrying only the price leaves the
 * description, the limit, and the composition alone, and a body carrying
 * {@code "limitQuantity": null} makes the tier unlimited rather than being read as
 * "no change".
 *
 * <p>{@code items} is a whole composition or nothing. There is no add-one-item or
 * remove-one-item patch, because a composition is what a backer is promised and the
 * client always holds all of it — a per-line patch would let two tabs each remove a
 * different line and leave a tier containing neither, with no request that ever said
 * so.
 *
 * <p>{@code shippingType} is the tier's shipping scope. The per-country rates are
 * <em>not</em> here: they are replaced wholesale through
 * {@code PUT /v1/rewards/{id}/shipping-rules}, because a rate table is read as a
 * whole by whatever quotes from it.
