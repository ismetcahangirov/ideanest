/**
 * What a client sends to add a reward tier to a campaign.
 *
 * <p>A title and a price. Unlike the campaign's goal, which a draft may be without,
 * the price is required here: a tier with no price is not something a backer can
 * select, and it would have to be excluded from every list and every total the page
 * shows.
 *
 * @param price {@code {"amount": "19.99", "currency": "AZN"}} — the amount a string,
 *     §10.3. The currency has to be the campaign's, which the service checks
 * @param shippingType one of {@code NONE, DIGITAL, LOCAL_PICKUP, DOMESTIC,
 *     INTERNATIONAL}. Omitted means {@code NONE}: a creator who has not said how a
 *     reward is delivered has not promised to ship it
 * @param items the composition, which may be empty. A creator writes the tier and then
 *     builds the items in it
