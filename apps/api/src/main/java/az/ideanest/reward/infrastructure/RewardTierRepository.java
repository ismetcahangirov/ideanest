/**
 * Reward tiers, by the campaign they belong to.
 *
 * <p>There is deliberately no <em>derived</em> method that writes
 * {@code claimed_quantity} or {@code reserved_quantity}. Spring Data would generate
 * one from a name, and it would be a path into the stock columns that takes no lock
 * and checks no limit. The five written by hand below — two of #51's, one of #52's
 * and two of #56's — are each a single conditional statement that cannot be called
 * wrongly: the condition that keeps the tier from overselling is inside the
 * {@code UPDATE}, not in the caller.
 *
 * <p><strong>Every one of them moves {@code n} places rather than one (#203).</strong>
 * They were written for the reward tier, where §7.2 gives a pledge a single
 * {@code reward_tier_id} and one place is all there ever is. An add-on is the same
 * kind of row — {@code is_addon} on {@code reward_tiers}, so it carries the same three
 * counters and the same {@code reward_tiers_stock_is_within_the_limit} — but §4.5's
 * PL-04 lets a backer take several of it, and until #203 nothing incremented anything
 * for one. Taking {@code n} places by issuing the one-place statement {@code n} times
 * would be {@code n} chances to be interrupted between the first and the last, and a
 * partial hold on a limited add-on is a checkout that has to be unwound by hand. So
 * the quantity moved into the statement and the condition moved with it:
 * {@code claimed + reserved + n <= limit} is evaluated by PostgreSQL, once, behind the
 * row lock, exactly as {@code < limit} was. At {@code n = 1} every statement below is
 * character for character what #51 and #52 shipped.

     *
     * <p><strong>This one statement is the reservation mechanism.</strong> The
     * {@code UPDATE} takes PostgreSQL's row lock on the tier, and under READ
     * COMMITTED it re-reads the row behind that lock and re-evaluates its
     * {@code WHERE} clause against what the transaction that held the lock actually
     * committed. So two checkouts racing for the last place are serialised by the
     * database: the second one's condition is false by the time it is evaluated, no
     * row is updated, and it is told the tier is full. A read followed by a write
     * cannot do that — both callers would read "one place left", and the code that
     * checked would not be wrong, merely not serialised.
     *
     * <p><strong>All {@code n} or none of them.</strong> A backer asking for three of
     * a limited add-on with two left is refused outright rather than sold two: the
     * quote they were shown, the amount they are about to be charged, and what the
     * creator has to put in the box are all for three. The arithmetic is inside the
     * condition, so "are there three left" and "take three" are one evaluation of one
     * row under one lock, and there is no window between them for anybody else's
     * second place to disappear.
     *
     * <p>{@code claimed_quantity} is in the condition as well as
     * {@code reserved_quantity}, because a place that has been confirmed is as taken
     * as one being held. It is the same expression as V7's
     * {@code reward_tiers_stock_is_within_the_limit}, which is the second line: if
     * this condition were ever wrong the constraint refuses the transaction rather
     * than letting the tier oversell.
     *
     * <p>A null {@code limit_quantity} is unlimited and always matches. The count is
     * still incremented, because §5.3 lets a creator add a limit later and the floor
     * it may be lowered to is the places already taken.
     *
     * <p><strong>{@code version} is deliberately not incremented.</strong> The column
     * is optimistic locking for the creator's fields, and the pledge module cannot
     * touch those — {@code claimed_quantity} and {@code reserved_quantity} are mapped
     * non-insertable and non-updatable, so there is no update here for an editor to
     * lose. Bumping it would make every checkout invalidate whatever edit the creator
     * had open, which on a busy campaign is an editor that cannot save. The rule it
     * might be thought to protect — that a limit is never lowered below what is taken
     * — is held by the check constraint against the row as it really is, not against
     * the copy the editor happens to be holding.
     *
     * <p>Native rather than JPQL, and no {@code clearAutomatically}: nothing reads a
     * {@code RewardTier} entity after this in the same transaction, and clearing the

     * saving. The flush before it is kept, so a pending write cannot be ordered after
     * this statement.

     * already exist here — release one, then claim one — and both orderings are
     * wrong, differently.
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li><strong>Release first.</strong> Between the two statements
     *       {@code claimed + reserved} is short of the limit, and that is not a
     *       private detail: it is exactly the expression {@link #reservePlaces}
     *       evaluates. A checkout arriving in that window takes the last place of a
     *       tier that has already sold it, and the second person to find out is the
     *       one who does not get a reward. The window is short, which makes it a bug
     *       that reproduces under load and never in a test.
     *   <li><strong>Claim first.</strong> Now {@code claimed + reserved} is
     *       <em>over</em> the limit for the same instant, and V7's
     *       {@code reward_tiers_stock_is_within_the_limit} is a check constraint:
     *       PostgreSQL evaluates it at the end of the statement, so it refuses the
     *       first update outright. A perfectly legitimate confirmation of the last
     *       place would fail on a full tier — always, not occasionally.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>So the correct order is no order. Both columns move in one {@code UPDATE},
     * the sum does not change, no other transaction sees an intermediate state
     * because there is not one, and the constraint is evaluated against a row whose
     * total is exactly what it was before. That is also why an add-on's whole
     * quantity is committed by one statement rather than by {@code n} of them (#203):
     * three separate moves would put the tier over or under the limit three times,

     * <p>{@code reserved_quantity >= :places} is the same guard
     * {@link #releasePlaces} carries and it is doing the same job: a confirmation
     * that ran twice would move a second set of places out of a reservation that no
     * longer exists, inventing a claim against nothing. Here it also serves as the
     * honest answer to "was this pledge really holding these places" — a zero return
     * is the caller's signal that it was not.
     *
     * <p>{@code version} is deliberately not incremented, for the reason
     * {@link #reservePlaces} gives: the column is optimistic locking for the
     * creator's own fields, and bumping it on every confirmation would invalidate
     * whatever edit the creator had open.
