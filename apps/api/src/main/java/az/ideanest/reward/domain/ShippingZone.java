/**
 * §4.8's PM-13: a name a creator gives to a group of destinations, so that
 * "ship to the European Union for 12" is one rate rather than twenty-seven.
 *
 * <p><strong>Per campaign rather than platform-wide.</strong> A list the platform
 * maintained would be the platform deciding whether "Europe" includes Turkey on
 * behalf of a creator whose carrier has already decided otherwise, with no way for
 * them to say so. A zone is a property of the tariff somebody negotiated, so it
 * belongs to whoever negotiated it.
 *
 * <p><strong>The countries are held here and not as an entity of their own.</strong>
 * {@code shipping_zone_countries} has no identity beyond the pair it holds, nothing
 * ever loads one, and every read of a zone wants all of them — the same argument
 * {@code survey_questions.choices} makes about options. What the table does give,
 * and a collection column could not, is the primary key on
 * {@code (project_id, country_code)}: a destination falls into at most one zone per
 * campaign, which is what keeps rate resolution a two-way question rather than an
 * n-way one with a priority column in it.
