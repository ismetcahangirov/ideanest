/**
 * A reward tier as its creator's editor sees it.
 *
 * <p>The response of every endpoint in this module that touches a tier — create,
 * patch, duplicate, reorder, shipping rates, and the list. One shape rather than one
 * per action, so a client applies the same update to its state whichever call it made,
 * and so that an endpoint cannot quietly start returning a field the others do not.
 *
 * <p>This is the <strong>creator's</strong> projection. It carries the secret token
 * and the reservation counts, neither of which belongs in a public response; the
 * campaign page's reward list is a different response owned by a different issue, and
 * it omits secret tiers altogether.
 *
 * <p><strong>Nulls are written out</strong>, for the reason {@code ProjectEdit} gives:
 * the editor binds a form to every field, and an absent key cannot be told from a
 * field that is genuinely unset.
 *
 * @param price amount and currency, the amount a string on the wire. §10.3, and
 *     {@link Money} for why
 * @param estimatedDelivery an ISO date. A month is what a creator can honestly
 *     promise, and the column is a date so that "which tiers are overdue" is a
 *     comparison
 * @param limitQuantity null means unlimited
 * @param claimedQuantity how many places are taken by confirmed pledges. Always zero
 *     until epic #50 writes it; read-only here in any case
 * @param reservedQuantity how many are held by a checkout in progress. #51 writes it
 * @param remainingQuantity {@code limitQuantity} minus what is claimed and reserved,
 *     or null when unlimited. Derived rather than stored, so it cannot disagree with
 *     the three numbers it comes from
 * @param secretToken the link that reaches a secret tier, or null. Present only in the
 *     creator's projection, because handing it out is the creator's decision
 * @param version the optimistic-locking counter. No endpoint takes it yet — see
 *     {@code RewardExceptionHandler} on {@code REWARD_MODIFIED} — and it is here so
 *     that a client which wants to send {@code If-Match} later does not need a second
 *     read to learn it
 * @param pricingLocked whether §5.3 has frozen this tier's {@code price}, which it
 *     does once the campaign is live. <strong>Here rather than in the campaign's
 *     {@code lockedFields}</strong>, which is filtered to
 *     {@code LockedField.Resource.PROJECT} and so can never name a field of this
 *     body — #183 is what happened when an editor tried to read it from there and
 *     silently never matched. A client uses it to stop offering an edit that is
 *     known to be refused; the refusal itself is still {@code REWARD_FIELD_LOCKED},
 *     because a client may be old, may be out of date, or may not be ours.
 *     <p>There is deliberately no counterpart for {@code limitQuantity}. §5.3
 *     permits raising it at any time, so no boolean describes it honestly: a lock
 *     the client could read as "not editable" would disable a control that works
