/**
 * A partial edit of a reward tier, with JSON Merge-Patch semantics (RFC 7396).
 *
 * <p>Every field is a {@link Patched}, so a body carrying only the price leaves the
 * description and the composition alone, and a body carrying
 * {@code "limitQuantity": null} makes the tier unlimited rather than being ignored.
 * The rewards tab autosaves one input at a time, which is what makes that distinction
 * load-bearing rather than pedantic.
 *
 * <p>Bean validation annotations are absent for the reason
 * {@code ProjectPatchRequest} gives: they cannot see inside a {@code Patched}, and a
 * rule enforced both here and in the service would be two rules that can disagree.
 *
 * <p>{@code items} replaces the whole composition when present. There is no
 * add-one-line patch, because a composition is what a backer is promised and the client
 * always holds all of it — a per-line patch would let two tabs each remove a different
 * item and leave a tier containing neither, with no request that ever said so.
 *
 * <p>The per-country rates are deliberately not here. They are replaced through
 * {@code PUT /v1/rewards/{id}/shipping-rules}, because a rate table is read as a whole
 * by whatever quotes from it.
