/**
 * A tier's complete shipping rate table.
 *
 * <p>{@code PUT}, and the whole table: a country left out of the body is a country the
 * creator has removed. Merging instead would leave them shipping somewhere they believe
 * they no longer do, and that is discovered by a backer selecting it.
 *
 * <p>An empty list is therefore a legitimate request, and it clears the table.
 *
 * <p><strong>Both halves in one body, since #77.</strong> A tier is priced by named
 * destinations and by regions, and they arrive together because a quote reads them
 * together: what a German backer pays depends on the presence of a German row
 * <em>and</em> on whether a region containing Germany is priced. Two endpoints would
 * let a creator commit half a rate change and go looking for the other half while the
 * first half quoted to backers.
 *
 * @param zoneRates §4.8's PM-13. Omitted is an empty table and clears the tier's
 *     regional rates, exactly as an omitted {@code rules} clears its per-country ones
