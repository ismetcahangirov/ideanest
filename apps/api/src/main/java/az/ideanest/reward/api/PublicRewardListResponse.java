/**
 * A campaign's public offer: the tiers a backer may choose, and the add-ons they may
 * put on top.
 *
 * <p>Two arrays rather than one with a flag, because they are two lists everywhere
 * they are shown — see {@code PublicRewardCatalogue#of}. The currency is stated once
 * for the whole body: every price in it is denominated in the campaign's currency, and
 * a client showing "no reward, just support" needs the currency even when both arrays
 * are empty.
 *
 * <p><strong>Nulls are written out</strong>, as they are on each tier. An empty
 * campaign answers {@code {"currency": "AZN", "rewards": [], "addons": []}} rather
 * than an object with keys missing: a client should not have to tell "no tiers" from
 * "this server does not send that key".

     * mean the same thing on every instance of the service and after a restart, and
     * nothing guarantees a record's hash does. It is computed here, beside the fields,
     * so that adding a field to this response and forgetting to cover it is a one-line
     * distance rather than a different file.
     *
     * <p><strong>Every field, including the stock.</strong> {@code remainingQuantity}
     * is the value that moves most often and the one a stale answer does the most harm
     * with — a digest that skipped it would hand a client a 304 for a list showing
     * places that have gone, which is precisely what PL-01 exists to prevent.
     *
     * <p>Not shared with {@code PublicReads}: that class is package-private in another
     * module's {@code api} package, and making it public to reuse eight lines of
     * {@link MessageDigest} would be a dependency between two modules that have
     * nothing else to say to each other — the argument {@code SecretTokens} already
     * makes about the auth module's generator.
