/**
 * The reward tiers a backer may choose from, with what is left of each.
 *
 * <p>§4.5 opens the pledge flow with "available tiers with stock", and PL-01 calls it
 * a live stock check. This is that read.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why this is not a method on {@link RewardService}.</strong> The two
 * answer different questions for different people, and almost nothing they do is
 * shared. That service is the creator's editor: every entry point begins by asking
 * {@link RewardAccess} who the caller is, it returns every tier including the secret
 * ones, and it exists to change them. This one has no caller identity to ask about —
 * a visitor deciding whether to back a campaign has usually not registered — and what
 * stands in for authorisation is the campaign's state. Folding a public read into a
 * class whose every other method starts with an authorisation check is how a public
 * read eventually inherits the wrong projection: {@code RewardDetail} carries the
 * reservation counts and the secret token, and the only thing keeping them off a
 * campaign page is that a different type is built here.
 *
 * <p><strong>What is filtered out, and what deliberately is not.</strong>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Secret tiers</strong> (PL-15). Absent unless the request presented the
 *       tier's own token. This is the other half of the sentence in
 *       {@code RewardController#list}: what makes a tier secret is that the public
 *       list leaves it out.
 *   <li><strong>Tiers outside their availability window.</strong> Against the injected
 *       {@link Clock}, never {@code Instant.now()}. §5.3 also expresses "withdraw a
 *       tier from sale" as an {@code available_until} in the past — a tier with
 *       backers may not be deleted — so this filter is what actually withdraws it.
 *   <li><strong>Sold-out tiers stay.</strong> A tier with no places left is returned
 *       with {@code remainingQuantity: 0}, because a backer looking at a campaign
 *       page needs to see that the early bird existed and has gone. Hiding it would
 *       make the page silently shorter every time a tier filled, and PL-01's job is
 *       to refuse the pledge, not to conceal the tier.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Three queries for a whole list</strong>, as {@code RewardService} does:
 * the tiers, their compositions, and their rates. A campaign page is the most-read
 * surface on the platform, and one query per tier is an N+1 that is only noticed when
 * there is enough traffic for it to matter.
