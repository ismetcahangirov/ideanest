/**
 * Where a creator is paid: filed by them, confirmed by somebody else — part of issue #432.
 *
 * <p>The answerer behind {@link PayoutDestinations}, which is what the payout module names.
 *
 * <h2>The thing this replaces</h2>
 *
 * <p>Until now the destination was a field on {@code PayoutController.SendRequest}, typed by
 * the member of staff pressing send. The controller's own comment called that the honest
 * shape of a real gap, and it was — but the gap was wider than a typo. §4.11 requires two
 * signatures above a threshold so that one person cannot move money alone, and a destination
 * chosen after those signatures, by one of the signatories, unreviewed, defeats the rule
 * entirely: the approvals were of an amount.
 *
 * <h2>Three names have to agree, and one comparison is automatic</h2>
 *
 * <p>#432 asks that the account holder be matched against #430's {@code legal_name} and
 * #429's certificate subject. The first is a string comparison and happens here, on every
 * save, using {@link LegalSubject#nameMatches} — the same forgiving-about-presentation,
 * strict-about-everything-else comparison #429's signature already uses, because two
 * vocabularies for one idea is one too many. The second is already enforced where the
 * signature is taken: a certificate naming somebody other than the legal name is refused with
 * {@code MISMATCHED_NAME} before an acceptance is written, so a destination matching the legal
 * name has by construction matched the certificate too.
 *
 * <p>A creator with no legal subject recorded cannot mismatch. There is nothing to compare
 * against, so the row waits for a reviewer, and asking for the subject is #430's gate at
 * submission rather than this one's.
 *
 * <h2>What cannot happen here yet, and is not pretended</h2>
 *
 * <p>Neither of #432's two ownership mechanisms can run. Mechanism A needs Epoint to confirm
 * in writing that sub-merchant onboarding validates a bank account (§9.3's R-10, which is
 * #422); mechanism B needs a statement feed. What exists is
 * {@link DestinationVerificationMethod#STAFF_ATTESTED} — the manual form of B, which is what
 * #432 describes B being at launch volumes — and the column records which of the three was
 * used, so a row verified by a person is never mistaken later for one a bank verified.
 *
 * <p>The tokenisation itself is the other half that waits. A creator supplies a provider
 * token; no adapter exists to issue one, exactly as none exists to issue a
 * {@code StoredCard#token()}. This is the same inert-behind-the-interface shape §9.2 chose
 * deliberately, and the gate below is real whether or not anything can yet get through it.
