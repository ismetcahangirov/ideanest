/**
 * Exceptions to compliance requirements: granted, withdrawn, and asked about — issue #436.
 *
 * <h2>Two audiences, and only one of them is authorised</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #isWaived} is asked by gates and needs no capability: a gate is the platform
 * asking itself a question about a rule it is enforcing, and there is no caller for it to
 * authorise. Everything that writes needs
 * {@link StaffCapability#GRANT_COMPLIANCE_OVERRIDE}, which only {@code ADMINISTRATOR} holds
 * — deliberately not {@code COMPLIANCE}, because a reviewer who could waive the requirement
 * they enforce holds both halves of it and the waiver stops being an exception anybody
 * escalated for.
 *
 * <p>The capability is checked here rather than by an annotation on the controller,
 * following {@code FeeSchedules} and {@code LegalDocuments}: this is also where the change
 * is recorded, and an authorised action nobody recorded and a recorded action nobody
 * authorised are the same defect from opposite ends.
 *
 * <h2>What this deliberately does not do</h2>
 *
 * <p><strong>It does not decide anything.</strong> An override says a requirement was
 * waived; whether that lets a payout through is #431's, whether it lets a submission
 * through is #429's. Those gates ask {@link #isWaived} and act on the answer, which is what
 * keeps this module from acquiring an opinion about payouts.
 *
 * <p><strong>It does not expire anything.</strong> There is no sweep and no state column.
 * {@code ComplianceOverride.isLiveAt} is a comparison, so an override stops working because
 * time passed rather than because a job ran — and a scheduler failing cannot leave every
 * override in the system live. What the row keeps is the history, which is the whole reason
 * expired rows are never deleted.

     * somebody granting a malicious one — it is somebody granting a reasonable one during an
     * outage and nobody ever looking at it again. A ceiling means the exception comes back
     * to a desk; a longer one means it comes back after the campaign it was granted for has
     * closed, which is the same as never.
     *
     * <p>Renewal is a second grant, with its own reason and its own name on it. That is more
     * ceremony than a still-valid exception deserves and exactly the right amount for the
     * case the ceremony is for.
