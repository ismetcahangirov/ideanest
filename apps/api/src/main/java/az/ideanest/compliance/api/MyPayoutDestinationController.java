/**
 * A creator says where their money goes — part of issue #432.
 *
 * <p>Under {@code /v1/me} beside the legal subject, and for the same reason: the destination is
 * a fact about the account rather than about a campaign. A creator with three campaigns is paid
 * to one account.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code PUT} and not {@code PATCH}</strong>, on {@code MyLegalSubjectController}'s
 * argument with an extra edge to it. The fields describe one account, so a partial update would
 * need a rule for what a missing token means — and the only safe rule, "keep the old one", is
 * how a creator changes the holder's name on somebody else's account.
 *
 * <h2>The token is supplied and not issued here, and nothing can issue one yet</h2>
 *
 * <p>The creator enters their bank details at the provider and the platform stores what comes
 * back, exactly as it stores a card token: {@code PayoutRequest} sets out at length why an IBAN
 * is not held here. No provider adapter exists to run that hosted flow — §9.2's refusal to ship
 * a stub, and #433 is what ends it — so in a deployed environment this endpoint has nothing
 * real to be handed. That is the same inert-behind-the-interface state the whole collection
 * path has been in since #61, and it is why the shape is worth having now: the gate, the
 * verification and the audit are real, and the day an adapter lands the flow in front of them
 * is the only thing missing.
