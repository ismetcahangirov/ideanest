/**
 * §9.4's provider abstraction (#61): one interface, one adapter per provider, so that
 * changing provider is a single file.
 *
 * <p><strong>The rule this interface exists to make enforceable is the last sentence
 * of §9.4: "No provider SDK is called anywhere except behind this interface."</strong>
 * It is not a style preference. §9.3 ends with "integrate at least two providers — if
 * the primary is unavailable on the day a large campaign closes, the entire business
 * stops", and a second provider is only a day's work if the first one's vocabulary
 * never leaked. The moment a decline code, a currency-in-minor-units, or a status
 * string from one provider reaches the collection run, the second integration becomes
 * a rewrite of everything that touched it.
 *
 * <p>{@code PaymentProviderBoundaryTests} checks the rule rather than restating it,
 * the same way {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} checks §16.1's.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing implements this yet, and that is the honest state</h2>
 *
 * <p>#60 — choose the payment provider and confirm §9.3's fourteen capabilities in
 * writing — is unanswered, and §9.2 says plainly why no stub ships in the meantime:
 * an adapter that returned an approval "would be worse than nothing: it would make
 * this path look finished and would have told clients that cards were verified when
 * no card was ever seen". The same argument applies with more force to
 * {@link #chargeStoredCard}, which moves real money.
 *
 * <p>So {@code PaymentProviders} finds no adapters in a deployed environment, and
 * {@code CollectionRun} refuses to start when it finds none. That refusal is the
 * single gate that keeps every piece of machinery built on top of this interface —
 * the batching, the circuit breaker, §9.6's schedule, the ledger posting — inert
 * until there is a real provider behind it, rather than half-working against a
 * pretend one.
 *
 * <h2>What an implementation must guarantee</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>It is a translator, not a decision maker.</strong> An adapter maps
 *       one call to one provider request and one provider response to one result. It
 *       does not retry — §9.6 owns the schedule and a hidden retry inside an adapter
 *       is a second charge nobody counted. It does not consult the database, does not
 *       write a transaction row, and does not post to the ledger.
 *   <li><strong>A refusal is a value; not being able to ask is a throw.</strong> See
 *       {@link ChargeResult} and {@link ProviderUnavailableException} for why the two
 *       cannot be the same thing.
 *   <li><strong>Card data never leaves it.</strong> §17.2 targets SAQ A. Anything a
 *       provider returns is redacted inside the adapter before it becomes a
 *       {@code rawResponse}, because that string is stored and logged.
 *   <li><strong>It is stateless and thread-safe.</strong> The collection run charges a
 *       batch concurrently; a single bean serves all of it.
 * </ul>
