     * The twelve below are AD-05's log -- #304, with #404's outcome filter and #412's
     * ordering. Three filter shapes, each with and without an outcome, each with a first page
     * and a keyset page; PaymentLogScope has the argument for why there are three shapes and
     * PaymentLogCursor has the one for why the keyset carries two values.
     *
     * ORDERED BY `created_at`, AND IT USED TO BE BY THE IDENTIFIER.
     *
     * The old argument was AuditEntryRepository's, made here for the same reason and wrong
     * here in the same way: both columns say the same thing -- the identifier is a UUID v7 and
     * carries the millisecond it was minted in (§7.3) -- and only one of them is unique, so
     * ordering by the primary key gave the same sequence with a cursor that was one value.
     *
     * The two columns are written by two different clocks. The identifier is minted in the
     * application when `PaymentTransaction` builds the row; `created_at` is `DEFAULT now()`
     * (V41) and is taken when the insert lands. A charge that mints its key before a provider
     * call and commits after it, two instances whose clocks differ, and anything migrated in
     * with a key from elsewhere all put the two orders out of step -- and `PaymentLogView`
     * renders the timestamp while the query ordered by the key.
     *
     * #404 found that on `audit_logs`, where the cost was an investigator scrolling. #412 is
     * the same defect on the one console surface that is entirely money, where the rows are
     * retry attempts against somebody's card and the order IS the evidence: §9.6 permits four
     * collection attempts, and "declined, declined, collected" read in the wrong order is a
     * different story about the same pledge.
     *
     * So every query below orders by `(created_at DESC, id DESC)` -- the column the screen
     * shows, with the key breaking the tie -- and each keyset predicate is the row-value
     * comparison that pair implies, written out rather than as a tuple because JPQL has no row
     * constructor. Four attempts on one pledge inside one second make the tie the ordinary
     * case here rather than the edge one, which is why the cursor carries both halves.
     *
     * WHAT IT COSTS, STATED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED LATER. V41's `transactions_pledge_idx` and
     * `transactions_project_idx` both end in `created_at DESC`, so the six scoped reads are
     * now the index's own order instead of a sort -- they got cheaper, not dearer. The other
     * two shapes had no index for this order at all, and V64 is that: it replaces V63's
     * `(status, id DESC)` with `(status, created_at DESC, id DESC)` and adds
     * `(created_at DESC, id DESC)` for the unfiltered read, which previously walked the
     * primary key. Both carry the identifier, so the keyset is exact rather than nearly
     * exact -- affordable here because they are new indexes, where adding `id` to V21's four
     * would have been a rebuild on a table that only grows.
