 * What a provider said about a call: one vocabulary for all four of them.

 * for the reason §8.4 gives about retry policies: two vocabularies for one idea is
 * one too many, and here the idea genuinely is one — the platform asked a provider
 * to move money and the provider either did, refused, or has not decided.
 *
 * <p>The cost is that a value can be unreachable for a particular call. A payout
 * that a provider answers synchronously never returns {@link #PENDING}. That is
 * cheaper than the alternative, which is four almost-identical enums and four
 * switches that have to be kept in step.
