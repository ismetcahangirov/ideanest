/**
 * §9.7, as an instruction: give this back.
 *
 * <p><strong>Nothing calls this today.</strong> Refunds are #67, and §9.7 is the
 * policy behind them. The type is here for #61's reason and one of its own: a
 * provider is chosen partly on §9.3's R-06, and an interface that could not express
 * a partial refund would have hidden the requirement until the day somebody needed
 * one.
 *
 * @param pledgeId which pledge is being refunded
 * @param providerTransactionId the charge being reversed. <strong>The provider's
 *     identifier and not ours</strong>: a refund is submitted against the original
 *     authorisation, and the platform's own transaction identifier means nothing on
 *     the other side
 * @param amount how much. Equal to the charge for a full refund, less for a partial
 *     one — which §9.3's R-06 makes a capability rather than an assumption, so #67
 *     checks {@link ProviderCapabilities#partialRefund()} before building one of
 *     these for less than the whole
 * @param reasonCode why, for {@code transactions} and for the provider's own dispute
 *     record. <strong>A string and not an enum</strong>, deliberately: #67 owns the
 *     vocabulary of §9.7's five scenarios, and inventing it here — in the issue that
 *     is only supposed to settle the interface — would mean #67 either inherits a
 *     list nobody designed or changes a type four other calls depend on
 * @param idempotencyKey §9.3's R-08. It matters more here than on a charge: a
 *     duplicated refund is money leaving the platform twice, and unlike a duplicated
 *     charge nobody complains about it
