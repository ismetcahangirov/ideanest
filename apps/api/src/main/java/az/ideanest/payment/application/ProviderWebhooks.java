/**
 * §9.3's R-07 and §17.2: verify a provider's delivery, refuse a replay, and act on it
 * exactly once (#66).
 *
 * <h2>The three controls, and what each of them is for</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>The signature</strong> makes the body ours to trust, and it is the
 *       adapter's — {@code PaymentProvider#parseWebhook} — because it is expressed in the
 *       provider's own header format. Verification and parsing are one call there
 *       precisely so that nothing in this class can hold an unverified
 *       {@link PaymentEvent}: the only thing that produces one is the method that checks.
 *   <li><strong>The timestamp</strong> stops a validly signed body being replayed later.
 *       A signature does not expire — that is what a signature is — so this window is the
 *       only thing that does. It is checked here rather than in the adapter because the
 *       tolerance is a platform policy and not a provider's format.
 *   <li><strong>The identifier</strong> stops the same event being acted on twice, and it
 *       is the only one of the three that survives a restart: signature and timestamp both
 *       pass on a genuine redelivery. V43's unique index is the enforcement.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>The delivery and its effect are one commit</h2>
 *
 * <p>V43 argues this at length and it is the whole shape of the class. There is no
 * {@code PENDING} row and no queue: the handler runs inside the transaction that writes
 * the row recording the delivery, so either both happened or neither did. A handler
 * that throws leaves no row, the response is a 500, and every provider in §9.3 retries a
 * delivery it did not get a 2xx for — which is why the platform needs no retry of its
 * own here and why it must not fake one by committing the row first.
 *
 * <h2>A concurrent redelivery is a 500, deliberately</h2>
 *
 * <p>Nothing catches the integrity violation V43's unique index raises when two
 * deliveries of one event arrive at the same instant and this one loses. The
 * transaction rolls back, the response is a 500, and the provider retries — at which
 * point the {@code exists} read answers it without doing anything. Catching it to
 * return a 200 would be answering for work another transaction has not finished.
 *
 * <h2>What is deliberately not here</h2>
 *
 * <p>No handler ships. See {@link PaymentEventHandler} for why that is the finished
 * state of #66 rather than half of it: verifying, deduplicating and dispatching is the
 * issue, and what a settled refund or a lost chargeback <em>means</em> belongs to #67
 * and #68, in the modules that own those outcomes.
