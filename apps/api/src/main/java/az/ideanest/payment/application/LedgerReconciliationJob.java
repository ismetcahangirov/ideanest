/**
 * §8.4's {@code ledger-reconciliation}, on its trigger — issue #70.
 *
 * <p>{@link LedgerReconciliation} decides what is wrong; this decides when to ask and what
 * happens to the answer. The split is the one every job in this service makes, and here it is
 * load-bearing: the arithmetic is a pure function of two queries and is unit-tested as one,
 * while the logging and the alarm level are operational choices that change without the
 * arithmetic changing.
 *
 * <h2>ERROR, and it means it</h2>
 *
 * Most failures in this service are logged at WARN because they self-heal — a cache hint that
 * was dropped, a provider that was briefly unreachable. A ledger that does not balance does
 * not self-heal, and every hour it stays unnoticed is an hour of money movements built on top
 * of a discrepancy nobody has explained. It is one of the three things §8.4 asks to be alerted
 * on, and it is the one that means somebody is woken up.
 *
 * <p><strong>The job does not throw when it finds something.</strong> Throwing is how a
 * {@code ScheduledJob} reports that it could not run — the runner counts the attempt, backs
 * off and eventually stops scheduling it. A pass that ran perfectly and found a discrepancy
 * has not failed; treating it as a failure would make the platform stop looking, which is
 * precisely the wrong response to having found something.
 *
 * <h2>The last report is kept, and being asked is the point</h2>
 *
 * §8.4's alert is on the imbalance, and there is a second, quieter failure it does not cover:
 * a reconciliation that stops running looks exactly like a platform whose books balance. So
 * the last report is held here and published through {@link #lastReport()}, timestamp
 * included, for §4.11's health screen and for whatever scrapes it — a check that has not run
 * since Tuesday is a finding of its own.
