/**
 * V54's disputes — issues #68 and #308.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@link #byProviderCase} is what makes webhook intake idempotent.</strong>
 * V43 establishes that a provider delivers a webhook more than once by design, so the
 * second delivery has to find the case rather than open a duplicate — and the unique index
 * on {@code (provider, provider_dispute_id)} is what guarantees it even when two
 * deliveries arrive at once.
 *
 * <p>The queue is ordered by deadline with nulls last. A provider that sends no deadline
 * is less urgent than one that does, not more — sorting nulls first would put the cases
 * nobody has a date for above the ones that expire tomorrow.
