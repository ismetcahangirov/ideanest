/**
 * The decision behind a refund — V53's row, issues #67 and #307.
 *
 * <p><strong>This is not where the money is.</strong> That is a {@code transactions} row
 * of type {@code REFUND} and the ledger entries behind it, both append-only. What lives
 * here is the half {@code transactions} deliberately does not carry: a reason code
 * somebody chose, the sentence they typed, who they were, and a state that exists before
 * any provider has been called. V53's header has the argument for the split.
 *
 * <p><strong>Two methods change anything</strong>, and they are the two outcomes. There is
 * no setter for the amount or the reason: a refund that could be edited after it was sent
 * would be a record of what somebody currently says they did.
