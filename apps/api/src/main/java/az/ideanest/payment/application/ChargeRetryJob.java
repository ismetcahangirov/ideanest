/**
 * §8.4's {@code charge-retry}, every six hours: §9.6's second, third and fourth
 * attempts, and the drop at the end of the window (#65).
 *
 * <h2>Six hours, not a minute</h2>
 *
 * <p>§9.6's slots are at +24 hours, +72 hours and +5 days, so nobody can tell an
 * attempt made at 24:00 from one made at 27:00, and a sweep every minute would be
 * fifteen hundred passes a day finding nothing. Late is safe here in a way it is not
 * for the initial collection: a retry is a second chance at a card the backer has been
 * told to change, and the thing that must be on time is the seven-day drop — which is
 * also measured in days.
 *
 * <h2>Two jobs and not one, which is the lease's doing</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code JobRunner} counts failures per job name and backs a failing job off to a
 * ten-minute cap and then {@code DEAD}. One job doing both queues would mean a database
 * problem in the retry sweep backing off the initial collection too — and the initial
 * collection is the pass that runs while a creator is watching their campaign close.
 * Two names, two lease rows, two failure budgets: the same argument §8.4 makes for
 * splitting {@code reminder-sender} from {@code deadline-reminder}.
 *
 * <h2>The drop is in this job rather than in one of its own</h2>
 *
 * <p>§8.4 does not list a {@code charge-dropper}, and it should not: the drop is the
 * last row of the same table the retries come from, its granularity is the same, and a
 * separate job would be a third lease row and a third failure budget for one bounded
 * {@code UPDATE}. It runs <em>after</em> the retries in each pass, so a pledge whose
 * final attempt is due in the same pass gets that attempt before its window is judged.
