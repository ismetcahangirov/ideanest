/**
 * Which payment provider, from §9.3's candidate table.
 *
 * <p><strong>An enum and not free text</strong>, because this value is half of two
 * uniqueness rules — {@code transactions_settled_provider_key} and
 * {@code provider_webhook_events_identity_key} — and a provider that is spelled two
 * ways is a provider whose events deduplicate against nothing. The names are also
 * the values stored in {@code transactions.provider} and
 * {@code provider_webhook_events.provider}, so renaming one is a data migration.
 *
 * <p><strong>Being on this list is not being integrated.</strong> §9.3 requires
 * fourteen capabilities confirmed in writing before a provider can be signed, and
 * #60 — which is the issue that does the confirming — is unanswered, so no adapter
 * for any of these ships. What the enum gives the platform before then is a closed
 * vocabulary: {@code PaymentProviders} resolves a configured name against it at
 * start-up, so a typo in a deployment's configuration is a start-up failure rather
 * than a webhook endpoint that quietly matches nothing.
 *
 * <p>§9.3's fourth row, "bank acquiring", is deliberately absent. Its terms are
 * negotiated individually, so it names a class of arrangement rather than an
 * integration, and a value nothing can ever be an adapter for would be a value that
 * only ever appears in a configuration mistake.
