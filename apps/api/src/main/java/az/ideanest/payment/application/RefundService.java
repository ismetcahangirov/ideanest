/**
 * Sending money back — §9.7, §4.11's AD-06, issues #67 and #307.
 *
 * <h2>Three commits, and the order is the whole design</h2>
 *
 * <p>A refund is a database write, a call to somebody else's server, and another database
 * write. No arrangement of those is atomic, so the only question is which failure the
 * platform prefers — and the answer is the one that leaves a record.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>Record the intent.</strong> A {@code REQUESTED} row carrying the
 *       idempotency key, committed before the provider is called. Call-then-record loses
 *       the case that matters: a call that reaches the provider and whose answer is lost.
 *       Money has gone, no row says anybody meant it to, and the key that would make a
 *       retry safe was never stored.
 *   <li><strong>Call the provider.</strong> Outside a transaction. A database transaction
 *       held open across a call to a third party is a connection pool waiting on somebody
 *       else's timeout.
 *   <li><strong>Record the outcome</strong>, with the {@code transactions} row and the
 *       ledger posting, in one transaction — those three are one fact.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>What remains is the window between two and three: the provider says yes and the
 * platform dies before recording it. The row stays {@code REQUESTED} with its key, which
 * is exactly enough for a reconciliation to find it and for a replay to be safe. That is a
 * gap somebody can close; a missing row is not.
 *
 * <p><strong>The commits live in {@link RefundRecords}</strong>, a separate bean, because
 * {@code @Transactional} is applied by a proxy and would do nothing at all if these steps
 * were methods on this class. That class has the argument.
 *
 * <h2>Two capabilities, not one</h2>
 *
 * <p>Reading the refund list needs {@code VIEW_FINANCE}; issuing one needs
 * {@code ISSUE_REFUND}. §4.11's AD-06 is one module and those are not one authority — the
 * mistakes are not comparable, and {@code StaffCapability} draws the line in the same
 * place for the same reason.
