/**
 * What a provider's webhook is about, in the platform's vocabulary rather than in the
 * provider's.
 *
 * <p><strong>Normalisation is the adapter's job and this enum is where it lands.</strong>
 * §9.3 requires at least two providers, and the two will not agree on the name of
 * anything: one sends {@code payment.captured} and the other {@code TRANSACTION_OK}.
 * If those strings reached the ingestion, every handler would carry a table of
 * synonyms and adding a third provider would mean editing all of them.
 *
 * <p>{@link #UNRECOGNISED} is what makes that safe. A provider sends every event type
 * it has, most of which the platform has not asked for, and an adapter that threw on
 * one would turn a provider's product announcement into a 500 and a retry storm
 * against an endpoint that has nothing to say. An unrecognised event is verified,
 * recorded, and answered 200 — see {@code provider_webhook_events.state}'s
 * {@code IGNORED}.
