/**
 * §9.5's last arrow, as an instruction: send the creator what is theirs.
 *
 * <p><strong>Nothing calls this today.</strong> Payouts are #69, and §6.3 puts a
 * fourteen-day hold and a dual approval in front of one. The type is here because
 * §9.4 names the call, and because §9.3's R-10 — split payment support — is a
 * decision about whether this call exists at all for a given provider, which is
 * easier to see when the call has a shape.
 *
 * @param payoutId the {@code payouts} row this executes. Carried so that the
 *     provider's reference and the platform's approval record name each other
 * @param creatorId who is being paid
 * @param amount the net, after §5.2's fees and #78's tax. The split itself is
 *     {@code ledger_entries}' and was decided at collection; this is one number
 * @param destinationReference where to. <strong>Opaque to this service</strong>, like
 *     {@link StoredCard#token()}: bank details are the provider's to hold, and a
 *     platform that stored an IBAN would have acquired a second class of sensitive
 *     data with none of the SAQ A reasoning behind the first
 * @param idempotencyKey §9.3's R-08, and here it is the difference between paying a
 *     creator once and twice
