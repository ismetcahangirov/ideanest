/**
 * §8.4's {@code charge-processor}, every minute: opens the collection of campaigns
 * that closed above goal, and charges the pledges it queued (#64).
 *
 * <p>Two halves in one job, in that order, and it matters that they are one job. A
 * campaign is opened and its pledges are charged in the same pass, so §9.6's first row
 * — "immediately after close" — is honoured to within the minute the finaliser already
 * costs. Splitting them would add a second minute for no gain, on the one pass where a
 * creator is watching.
 *
 * <h2>Rate limiting, which is §9.3's R-09</h2>
 *
 * <p>The rate limit is <strong>{@code charges-per-pass} per tick</strong>, and that is
 * the whole of it. At the default hundred a minute the platform makes roughly 1.7
 * requests a second to a provider — a figure that can be agreed with one in advance,
 * which is what R-09 asks for, rather than one discovered by being throttled during a
 * campaign's close. A campaign with four thousand backers therefore takes about forty
 * minutes to collect, which is well inside §9.6's first day.
 *
 * <p>There is deliberately no sleeping inside a pass to smooth the rate further. A
 * sleep would hold the job's lease — {@code ideanest.jobs.lock-lease}, a minute — and a
 * pass that outlasts its lease is joined by a second replica, which is the one thing
 * this job's per-pledge row lock is protecting against.
 *
 * <h2>The circuit breaker ends a pass, and does not end the job</h2>
 *
 * <p>A {@link CollectionOutcome#PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE} stops the pass immediately:
 * every remaining pledge would meet the same outage. The job itself does not fail —
 * {@code JobRunner} would count the failure, back it off exponentially, and eventually
 * mark it {@code DEAD}, which would mean a provider's bad ten minutes stopping
 * collection until somebody reset a row by hand. A returned pass and a breaker that
 * closes on its own is the recovery that needs nobody.
