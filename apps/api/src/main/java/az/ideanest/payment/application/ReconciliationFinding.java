/**
 * One thing the reconciliation found wrong — issues #70 and #403.
 *
 * <p>A finding is a sentence somebody has to act on. The kind is what a metric counts and an
 * alert routes on; {@link #detail} is what the person woken by that alert reads first, and it
 * carries the figures rather than pointing at a query they would have to write.
 *
 * <h2>It carries its parts as well as its sentence, and that is #403</h2>
 *
 * <p>This record held {@code kind}, {@code currency} and {@code detail}, and said so at
 * length: "no account identifier, no campaign, no amount as a separate field — they are in
 * the detail where they belong: this is a log line and a health row, not a table somebody
 * joins against".
 *
 * <p>That was true of the two readers it had. It stopped being true when {@code
 * /admin/reconciliation} became the third, because a console screen renders to a person in
 * their own language and an English sentence with a raw UUID and an unformatted amount in it
 * is the only part of that screen carrying the actual result. A prose-only finding cannot be
 * translated by anybody, which made the sentence the API's opinion about what Azerbaijani
 * reads like.
 *
 * <p>So the parts travel beside the sentence: {@link #code} says which of the four shapes this
 * is — {@link Kind} cannot, because two of them are {@code IMPOSSIBLE_SIGN} and read in
 * opposite directions — and the console builds its own sentence from the parts, with the
 * account named and the money formatted the way every other figure on the platform is. The
 * detail is unchanged and is still what the log line prints, because a log line in the
 * reader's language would be a log line nobody can grep.
 *
 * @param code which of the four checks produced this, and therefore which sentence it is
 * @param account the ledger account it is about — {@code escrow}, {@code creator:<id>} — or
 *     null for the two findings that are about a whole currency rather than one position
 * @param currency the currency the discrepancy is in. §21.2 refuses to add two, so a finding
 *     is always about exactly one
 * @param amount the figure the sentence turns on: the net that should have been zero, the
 *     balance whose sign is impossible, or the ledger's side of a disagreement
 * @param otherAmount the second figure, for the one finding that compares two — the payments'
 *     side of {@link Code#DISAGREES_WITH_PAYMENTS}. Null everywhere else
 * @param detail what is wrong, with the numbers in it, in English. The log line
