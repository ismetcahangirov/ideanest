/**
 * §8.4's {@code ledger-reconciliation}: does the platform's money add up? Issue #70.
 *
 * <h2>Three questions, and each one can be wrong on its own</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>Do the books balance?</strong> Summed per currency across every account, the
 *       debits must equal the credits. V41's deferred constraint trigger refuses a posting
 *       that does not, so a failure here means a row arrived past both the application and the
 *       trigger — which is the one thing this whole job exists to notice.
 *   <li><strong>Does any account hold a sign it cannot?</strong> Escrow below zero is the
 *       platform having paid out money it never took. A creator's account above zero is a
 *       creator paid more than they earned — {@code AccountTotal} names that one in as many
 *       words as "worth an alert when it does". Neither is caught by the first check, because
 *       two errors of opposite sign balance perfectly.
 *   <li><strong>Does the ledger agree with the record of what moved?</strong> Escrow plus the
 *       provider's fees must equal the settled charges less the payouts and the money returned.
 *       The left-hand side comes from the ledger and the right from {@code transactions}, so
 *       this is the only one of the three that could catch a posting the application simply
 *       never made.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>WHY THERE IS NO COMPARISON AGAINST A PROVIDER'S SETTLEMENT REPORT</h2>
 *
 * Because there is no provider. §9.3's choice is #60 and carries {@code status:
 * needs-decision}; {@code PaymentProviders} discovers no implementation, and hosted card
 * tokenisation (#55) is blocked behind the same decision. A settlement comparison written
 * now would be a parser for a file format nobody has agreed to, checked against a fixture
 * this repository invented — which is worse than an absence, because it would look like
 * coverage.
 *
 * <p>Check three is the shape that comparison will take, against the one counterparty that
 * exists today: the platform's own record of every transaction it believes settled. When a
 * provider is chosen, its report becomes a fourth source on the same right-hand side, and
 * the arithmetic below does not change.
 *
 * <h2>It reports rather than repairs</h2>
 *
 * Nothing here writes to the ledger. An imbalance is a fact about money that a person has to
 * look at — the correcting entry depends on which of a dozen things went wrong, and a job
 * that guessed would turn a detectable problem into an undetectable one. {@code
 * ReconciliationReport} is what it produces and {@code LedgerReconciliationJob} is what runs
 * it on §8.4's daily schedule.
