/**
 * {@code campaign-refunds} — IDN-EXT-01 (#40): every backer refunded in full.
 *
 * <p>§9.7's four cases that refund everybody are three campaign states: {@code UNSUCCESSFUL} (day 8
 * below 80%, or an extension ended below it), {@code SUSPENDED}, and {@code CANCELED}. A pass refunds
 * a bounded batch of their settled charges with money left (#171: per charge, whatever the pledge's
 * state, and every charge of a raise that could not be applied), oldest charge first, each in its own
 * transactions so one refusal does not stop the rest; then it settles refunds whose outcome was lost
 * from the provider's status of the payment — staff refunds too since #174's review, and only where
 * that status can say which refund it was ({@code RefundService#reconcile}), least recently asked
 * first (#183). A pledge becomes
 * {@code REFUNDED} when the refund that leaves nothing on it settles, not when it is requested.
 *
 * <p>A sweep rather than a listener on the campaign's event, because a refund is a provider call and
 * a campaign of thousands of backers must not be one delivery that either succeeds entirely or is
 * retried entirely. A refused refund is tried again after {@code retry-after}, not on the next minute.
