/**
 * Chargebacks — §4.11's AD-07, issues #68 and #308.
 *
 * <h2>Intake is idempotent because the provider is not</h2>
 *
 * <p>V43 establishes that a webhook is delivered more than once by design. {@link #notified}
 * therefore finds the existing case rather than opening a second, and V54's unique index on
 * {@code (provider, provider_dispute_id)} is what holds when two deliveries arrive at the
 * same moment. A duplicate case is worse than a missing one: two deadlines, two people
 * assembling evidence, and two answers sent to a network that asked once.
 *
 * <p>It also <strong>reopens a resolved case</strong> when the provider raises it again,
 * which is the cycle {@code DisputeState} describes and the reason nothing here asserts
 * that a dispute only moves forward.
 *
 * <h2>The money moves when the case is lost, not when it is opened</h2>
 *
 * <p>A notification is not a movement — the network has taken nothing yet, and a posting at
 * intake would put the platform's books out by every dispute it goes on to win. The ledger
 * is written on {@link DisputeState#LOST} and on {@link DisputeState#CONCEDED}, which are
 * the two outcomes where the money is actually gone.
 *
 * <p><strong>The fee is posted separately from the amount.</strong> They come off different
 * accounts because they are different facts: the disputed amount is a backer's money going
 * back, and the fee is the platform's cost of being asked. Netting them would hide the
 * second inside the first, and the second is the number that makes contesting worthwhile.
