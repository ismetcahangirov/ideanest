/**
 * §10.2's {@code POST /v1/webhooks/psp/{provider}} (#66).
 *
 * <p><strong>The only unauthenticated write endpoint on the platform</strong>, and
 * everything about it is arranged around that. There is no session, no token and no
 * account: the sender is a payment provider, and the only thing that distinguishes it
 * from anybody who has guessed the URL is a signature over the body. So the controller
 * does as close to nothing as an endpoint can — it hands the bytes and the headers to
 * {@code ProviderWebhooks}, which hands them to the adapter that can verify them, and
 * makes no decision of its own that could be reached without a valid signature.
 *
 * <h2>{@code byte[]} and not a bound request type</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every other controller in this service binds a validated record. This one takes
 * the raw body, because <strong>a signature is over the bytes</strong>: a body parsed
 * into objects and serialised again is a different sequence of them, and the check
 * would fail for every provider that signs the payload rather than a digest of a few
 * named fields. It also means a body the platform cannot parse is still verifiable, and
 * therefore still recordable, rather than being rejected by Jackson before anything has
 * established who sent it.
 *
 * <h2>Everything the platform has finished with is a 200</h2>
 *
 * <p>Processed, ignored and already-seen are all 200 with an empty body. A provider
 * retries anything that is not a 2xx, so the status is an instruction about retrying
 * rather than a description — and a body distinguishing the three would tell whoever
 * has the URL which events the platform acts on. The distinction is in the log and in
 * {@code provider_webhook_events}, where the question is actually asked.
 *
 * <p>What is <em>not</em> a 200 is a delivery the platform failed to handle, which is a
 * 500 and a retry, and a delivery it refused, which is a 400 or a 404 and no retry. See
 * {@code ProviderWebhookExceptionHandler}.
 *
 * <h2>What is deliberately absent</h2>
 *
 * <p><strong>No rate limiting.</strong> Every other public endpoint has some, and this
 * one is protected by something better: an unsigned body is refused before anything is
 * read, and a valid signature cannot be produced by whoever would be flooding it. A
 * limiter here would instead throttle a provider delivering a genuine backlog after an
 * outage — exactly when the platform most needs the deliveries.
 *
 * <p><strong>No source allowlist.</strong> §17.2 lists one and it belongs to the
 * deployment's network rather than to this class: the address a Java servlet sees is
 * whatever proxy terminated the connection, so an allowlist here would either match the
 * load balancer or trust an {@code X-Forwarded-For} that the sender controls. §19.1 is
 * where it goes.
