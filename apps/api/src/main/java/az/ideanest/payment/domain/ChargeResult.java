/**
 * What the provider said about a {@link StoredCardChargeRequest}.
 *
 * <p><strong>A decline is a result and not an exception</strong>, and that is the
 * single most important thing about this type. §9.6 puts collection failure at 5–15%
 * of pledges at a campaign's close, so on a campaign with four thousand backers
 * several hundred declines are the expected Tuesday; modelling them as thrown
 * exceptions would make the ordinary path the exceptional one and would put the
 * decline code — the thing §9.6's whole schedule is driven from — into a message
 * string.
 *
 * <p>What <em>is</em> an exception is not being able to ask: a timeout, a connection
 * refused, an answer nobody can parse. Those are {@link ProviderUnavailableException},
 * because the platform then does not know what happened to the money, which is a
 * different situation from knowing that nothing did.
 *
 * @param outcome approved, declined, or accepted and not yet decided
 * @param providerTransactionId the provider's identifier for the call. Present on an
 *     approval and on a decline the provider recorded; null only when the provider
 *     answered without one
 * @param failureCode why it was refused, in the provider's vocabulary, normalised by
 *     the adapter to something short enough for {@code transactions.failure_code}.
 *     Required on a decline and refused on anything else — a code on an approval is a
 *     row every report filtering on the column will read as a failure
 * @param failureMessage the same thing in words, for the support conversation and for
 *     nothing else. <strong>Never shown to a backer</strong>: §4.10's payment-failed
 *     notification says "update your card", because a provider's message is written
 *     for a merchant and half of them name the issuer's internal reason
 * @param rawResponse the provider's answer as JSON, stored verbatim in
 *     {@code transactions.provider_response}. §17.2's redaction happens in the adapter
 *     before this is built, not after
