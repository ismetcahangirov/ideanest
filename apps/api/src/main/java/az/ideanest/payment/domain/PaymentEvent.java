/**
 * A provider's webhook, verified and normalised: §9.3's R-07 and §17.2's row.
 *
 * <p>Produced by {@link PaymentProvider#parseWebhook}, which means <strong>an
 * instance of this type is a body whose signature has already been checked</strong>.
 * That is the invariant the whole of #66 rests on, and it is why parsing and
 * verification are one call rather than two: two calls can be made in the wrong
 * order, and the wrong order here is acting on an instruction from anybody who knows
 * the URL.
 *
 * @param provider which adapter verified it. Half of the deduplication key, because
 *     two providers' identifiers share no namespace
 * @param providerEventId the provider's own identifier for the event. The other half,
 *     and the thing a redelivery repeats. <strong>Not a hash of the body</strong>: a
 *     provider that re-sends with a refreshed timestamp changes the bytes and not the
 *     event
 * @param type what happened, normalised. See {@link PaymentEventType}
 * @param providerTransactionId which call it is about, in the provider's namespace.
 *     Null on an event that is not about one — which is most of what arrives, since
 *     {@link PaymentEventType#UNRECOGNISED} covers everything the platform did not ask
 *     for
 * @param amount how much the event is about, when it says. Null when the event
 *     carries no amount. Never used to <em>decide</em> anything — the platform's own
 *     record of what was charged is {@code transactions}, and an amount taken from a
 *     webhook is an amount taken from somebody else's system
 * @param signedAt when the provider says it signed. §17.2's replay check compares it
 *     against {@code ideanest.payment.webhooks.tolerance}, and it is stored so that
 *     "how far behind were deliveries during the incident" is answerable
 * @param rawBody the bytes as they arrived, as text. Stored verbatim in
 *     {@code provider_webhook_events.payload}, because in a dispute what matters is
 *     what was signed
