/**
 * §4.11's AD-05 payment log, read — #304.
 *
 * <p>Every charge the platform has attempted, its provider reference, and why the refused
 * ones were refused. It is the read half of a table {@code CollectionRun} writes and
 * nothing updates, so there is no consistency question here at all: a row that exists said
 * the same thing yesterday and will say it next year.
 *
 * <p><strong>No authorisation and no audit row here.</strong> Both live in
 * {@code admin.application.PaymentLogService}, one layer out, for the reason
 * {@code AuditTrail} gives: the module that owns the table publishes the read, and the
 * module that owns the console decides who may take it and records that they did. Putting
 * the staff check here would put {@code shared.access} in front of the collection run as
 * well, which has no caller to check.
 *
 * <p><strong>It is a projection boundary as much as a service.</strong> The rows leave here
 * as {@link LoggedTransaction}, which is what lets the admin module read this table without
 * naming a {@code domain} type — see that record for why that rule is doing real work
 * rather than being satisfied for form's sake.
