/**
 * Why money was sent back — §9.7 and §4.11's AD-06, issues #67 and #307.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code RefundRequest.reasonCode} is a {@code String} and this is the
 * vocabulary behind it.</strong> That type's comment says so: "#67 owns the vocabulary of
 * §9.7's five scenarios, and inventing it here — in the issue that is only supposed to
 * settle the interface — would mean #67 either inherits a list nobody designed or changes
 * a type four other calls depend on". This is #67 keeping that promise.
 *
 * <p><strong>A closed set because refunds are counted.</strong> §4.11 asks for "reason
 * codes" rather than "reasons", and the difference is that "how many refunds were because
 * a campaign was halted" has a number for an answer. Free text makes it a question with a
 * spreadsheet for an answer, which is what {@code refunds.detail} is for — the code is
 * the countable half and the detail is the story.
 *
 * <p>The values match V53's {@code CHECK} exactly, and both exist for {@code
 * ReportTargetType}'s reason: the enum stops the writing side inventing a spelling, and
 * the constraint holds against a support script.
