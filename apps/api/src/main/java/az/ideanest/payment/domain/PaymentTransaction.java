/**
 * §7.2's {@code transactions}: one call to a payment provider, and what it said.
 *
 * <p><strong>Insert only.</strong> V41 makes that true of the database with a
 * statement-level trigger; here it is expressed as every column being
 * {@code updatable = false}, no setters, and static factories that produce a
 * <em>finished</em> row. There is no {@code markSucceeded}, because §7.2 says
 * corrections are new rows and because a mutable status is how a ledger stops being
 * evidence.
 *
 * <p><strong>Named {@code PaymentTransaction} rather than {@code Transaction}.</strong>
 * The unqualified word already means something in every file that touches Spring —
 * {@code @Transactional}, {@code TransactionTemplate}, the transaction this row is
 * written in — and a class called {@code Transaction} in a service where a
 * transaction is also a unit of work is an import somebody gets wrong at three in the
 * morning. The table keeps §7.2's name.
 *
 * <p><strong>A declined charge is a row.</strong> The most common mistake in this
 * shape of table is to write only the successes, and it costs exactly the thing §9.6
 * is built on: without the declines there is no attempt history, no decline code, and
 * no way to tell a card that was refused four times from a card nobody tried.
