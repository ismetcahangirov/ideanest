/**
 * One pledge, one card, one transaction (#64, #65).
 *
 * <p>The single most consequential method on the platform is {@link #collectNext}, and
 * everything about how it is arranged is chosen to make one sentence true:
 * <strong>a backer's card is charged at most once per attempt, and every charge that
 * happens is recorded, posted and announced in the same commit.</strong>
 *
 * <h2>The transaction covers the provider call, deliberately</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code PledgeCollection#claimNextDue} takes the pledge with {@code FOR UPDATE SKIP
 * LOCKED}, and that lock is held across the HTTP call to the provider. Holding a
 * database lock across a network call is normally a mistake, and here it is the design:
 * it is what serialises everything about one pledge, so a second replica cannot make
 * attempt three while this one is waiting to hear about attempt three. {@code SKIP
 * LOCKED} means the second replica takes a different pledge rather than waiting.
 *
 * <p>What it costs is a pooled connection held for the duration of a provider call,
 * which is why the pass is bounded by {@code charges-per-pass} and why an adapter is
 * expected to have a short timeout. The alternative — claim, commit, charge, commit
 * again — has a window in which the process can die after charging and before
 * recording, and the recovery from that is reading somebody's card statement.
 *
 * <h2>What happens for each answer</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Approved.</strong> The pledge becomes {@code COLLECTED}, a
 *       {@code SUCCEEDED} transaction is written, the ledger is posted, and
 *       {@code pledge.collected} goes out. Four writes, one commit.
 *   <li><strong>Declined.</strong> The pledge becomes {@code CHARGE_FAILED} with its next
 *       slot from §9.6, a {@code FAILED} transaction is written with the provider's
 *       decline code, and — from the second attempt on — the backer is told. No ledger
 *       entry: nothing moved.
 *   <li><strong>Accepted and undecided.</strong> Nothing moves. A {@code PENDING}
 *       transaction is written once, the attempt is <em>not</em> counted, and the pledge
 *       is asked about again shortly. Counting it would burn one of the backer's four
 *       chances on an answer nobody has received, and it would change the idempotency key
 *       — so the next call would be a second charge rather than a question about the
 *       first.
 *   <li><strong>Unreachable.</strong> A {@code FAILED} transaction with
 *       {@code provider_unreachable}, the attempt not counted, the breaker told, and the
 *       pledge left where it was. §9.6's four attempts are four chances at a card, not
 *       four chances at a network.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Nothing happens in a deployed environment</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link PaymentProviders#primary()} is empty, because #60 has not chosen a provider
 * and §9.2 refuses a stub. {@link #collectNext} therefore returns
 * {@link CollectionOutcome#NO_PROVIDER} without touching a pledge, and it does so before
 * anything is claimed. That single refusal is what keeps the batching, the breaker,
 * §9.6's schedule and the ledger posting inert until there is something real behind
 * them.
