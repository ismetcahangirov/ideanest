/**
 * What the fraud queue refuses — issue #108.
 *
 * <p>Scoped to {@link RiskController} rather than applied globally, for the reason every
 * other advice in the service gives: an advice that catches a broad type across the whole
 * application turns a bug somewhere else into a tidy 4xx and hides it.
 *
 * <p>It is a second copy of {@code ConsoleExceptionHandler}'s one handler rather than an
 * extension of it, because that advice names its three controllers explicitly and adding a
 * fourth from another module would make an admin-module class the place a risk-module route
 * is configured. The body is deliberately identical: a client that already handles
 * {@code NOT_A_MODERATOR} should not need another branch for this route, and when epic
 * #100 replaces the staff list with a role model they change together.
