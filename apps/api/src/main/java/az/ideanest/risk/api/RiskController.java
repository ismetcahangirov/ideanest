/**
 * §4.11's AD-02 fraud signals over HTTP — issue #108. The row that said "fraud signals are
 * not built".
 *
 * <h2>Staff only, audited, and never cached</h2>
 *
 * <p>The same three rules {@code AuditTrailController} and {@code PaymentLogController}
 * follow, for a reason that is sharper here: this is a list of people the platform's
 * arithmetic has found suspicious. Reading it is a privileged act and §17.4 requires the
 * act to be recorded, and a shared cache holding it would be a copy of that list outside
 * the console.
 *
 * <p>The audit row names how many rows were read and never who was in them, following
 * {@code ConsoleReadService}: an audit trail that reproduced the queue would be a second
 * copy of it with no retention rule.
 *
 * <h2>Marking one reviewed is not a verdict</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code POST .../reviewed} records that somebody looked. It records nothing about what
 * they concluded — see {@link RiskAssessment#reviewedBy}: the conclusion is a refund, a
 * suspension or a ticket, and each of those is recorded by the module that took it. A
 * second free-text verdict here would be a place for the two to disagree.
