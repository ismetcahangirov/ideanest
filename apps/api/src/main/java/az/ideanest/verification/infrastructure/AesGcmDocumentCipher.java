/**
 * {@link DocumentCipher} as AES-256-GCM over the document's bytes — issue #105.
 *
 * <h2>The same envelope as a shipping address, deliberately</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code AesGcmAddressCipher} makes every one of the arguments below and this class
 * repeats the parameters rather than inventing its own: AES-256-GCM, a 12-byte nonce from
 * {@link SecureRandom} on every seal, a 128-bit tag, no additional authenticated data. One
 * platform with two encryption schemes is one platform whose second scheme is the one
 * nobody reviews.
 *
 * <p>What is <strong>not</strong> shared is the key. A document key and an address key are
 * separate labels in separate configuration blocks, because they protect different things
 * with different lifetimes — an address is held for as long as a pledge needs fulfilling
 * and a passport photograph for seven days after a decision — and one key for both would
 * mean rotating one to rotate the other.
 *
 * <h2>Why the plaintext is not JSON here</h2>
 *
 * <p>An address is eight fields and is sealed as a JSON document so that a ninth reads back
 * as null on old rows. A document is a photograph: there is nothing to add a field to, and
 * wrapping bytes in base64 inside JSON would grow every row by a third for nothing.
 *
 * <h2>Unconfigured</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #isConfigured()} answers false and {@link #seal} refuses. The caller turns that
 * into a 503 rather than a 500: a deployment with no key cannot take documents, and telling
 * a creator their photograph failed to upload would send them to try again for ever.
