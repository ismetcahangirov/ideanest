/**
 * Identity verification for creators — issue #105. The one door into
 * {@code identity_verifications} and {@code identity_documents}.
 *
 * <h2>Restricted access is what this class mostly is</h2>
 *
 * <p>#105's title is "document capture with restricted access and a retention limit", and
 * the middle third is enforced here rather than in a controller. Three rules, and none of
 * them is optional:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>A creator reaches their own verification and nobody else's.</strong> Every
 *       creator-facing method takes the caller's account identifier and the query is keyed
 *       on it — there is no method that takes a verification identifier from a creator.
 *   <li><strong>Only platform staff open a document, and every opening is audited.</strong>
 *       {@link #openDocument} is the single route to plaintext and it writes an audit row
 *       before it returns one. A read of somebody's passport that nobody can reconstruct is
 *       the failure §17.4 is about.
 *   <li><strong>Nothing lists documents across people.</strong> The repository has no such
 *       query, so a screen that wanted one could not be written by accident.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>The retention limit is enforced in two places, and that is not redundancy</h2>
 *
 * <p>A decision erases the documents behind it at once — that is the ordinary path, and it
 * is synchronous because a reviewer who has finished looking has no further need of the
 * photograph. {@code DocumentRetentionJob} is the backstop for the submission nobody ever
 * decides, which the ordinary path by definition never reaches.
 *
 * <h2>What is deliberately NOT here</h2>
 *
 * <p><strong>No threshold, and nothing gated.</strong> A campaign launches, a pledge is
 * taken and a payout is calculated exactly as before, whatever a verification says. §22.1
 * lists "identity verification thresholds for creators" among the questions requiring a
 * specific legal answer, and #71 carries {@code status: needs-decision}. A threshold
 * invented here would be a compliance position this repository made up and the one a
 * regulator would read back to us. {@code VerificationProperties.required} is where it goes
 * on the day somebody may decide it.
