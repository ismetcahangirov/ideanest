 * What identity verification refuses, as RFC 9457 problem details (§10.4) — issue #105.
 *
 * <p>Scoped to this module's two controllers rather than declared globally, exactly as
 * {@code NotificationExceptionHandler} is: an advice that catches a broad type across the
 * whole application turns a bug somewhere else into a tidy 4xx and hides it.
 *
 * <p><strong>No detail here repeats anything from a document.</strong> Not a filename, not
 * a media type the client claimed, not a byte. A problem detail is a document a client may
 * log, and the subject is somebody's passport.
