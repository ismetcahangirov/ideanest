 *
 * <p><strong>Nulls are written out.</strong> A campaign nobody has commented on answers
 * {@code {"threads": [], "nextCursor": null}} rather than an object with a key missing.
 *
 * @param nextCursor the identifier to ask below for the next page of conversations, or
 *     null when this is the last one. A comment's own identifier, which the client
 *     already holds for every row on the page — there is nothing to obfuscate, and an
 *     opaque token would only need decoding
