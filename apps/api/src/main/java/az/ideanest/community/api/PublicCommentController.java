/**
 * The Comments tab. §10.2's {@code GET /v1/projects/{id}/comments}, listed under
 * "Project — public".
 *
 * <p><strong>Public, and still identity-aware</strong>, exactly as
 * {@code PublicProjectUpdateController} is: the filter chain permits this path without
 * a token, and when one is presented the resource server still validates it — which is
 * what lets a creator read the comments on a campaign the public cannot see yet.
 *
 * <p><strong>Two reads on one route.</strong> Without {@code thread} it is the tab: a
 * page of conversations, each with a preview of its replies. With it, one conversation
 * and a page of its replies — what the "show more replies" control asks for. A query
 * parameter rather than a second route, because it is the same resource with a narrower
 * question, and a second route would need its own cache policy and its own security
 * rule to be kept in step with this one.
 *
 * <h2>Caching</h2>
 *
 * <p>§10.3 asks for {@code ETag} and {@code Cache-Control} on a public read.
 * {@code public, no-cache} for everybody — "keep this body and ask before you use it
 * again". Unlike the Updates tab there is no private variant, because there is no
 * private content: a comment has no {@code BACKERS_ONLY} and no scheduling, so the
 * campaign's own team is served the same page as a visitor and the body is shareable.
 *
 * <p>A {@code max-age} is deliberately not offered. This is the one surface on the
 * campaign page where a person is waiting for an answer to the question they just
 * asked, and buying throughput by making exactly that request the stale one is the
 * wrong trade. The policy is written on the raw response rather than on the
 * {@code ResponseEntity}, because {@code checkNotModified} writes the 304 itself and
 * never passes through one.
