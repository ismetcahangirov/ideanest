 * sends it back as {@code ?cursor=}. Offsets are not offered, because an update
 * published between two requests would shift every page after it and the reader would
 * see one twice or not at all.
 *
 * <p><strong>Nulls are written out.</strong> A campaign with no updates answers
 * {@code {"updates": [], "nextCursor": null}} rather than an object with a key missing:
 * a client should not have to tell "this is the last page" from "this server does not
 * send that key".
 *
 * @param nextCursor the number to ask below for the next page, or null when this is the
 *     last one. It is an update's number and therefore public information already —
 *     there is nothing to obfuscate and an opaque token would only need decoding

     * hash does. Computed beside the fields, so that adding one and forgetting to cover
     * it is a one-line distance rather than a different file.
     *
     * <p><strong>The body is part of the tag, not just the number.</strong> An update is
     * immutable today, so a tag over the numbers alone would be correct — and it would
     * stop being correct the moment AD-09's moderation edits or withdraws one, silently,
     * by serving a 304 for a page that had changed.
     *
     * <p>The cursor is covered too. Two pages of one campaign are different bodies and
     * must not share a tag; without it, a client that had page two cached would be told
     * page one had not changed.
