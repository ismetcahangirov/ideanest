/**
 * Managing the FAQ tab. §10.2's {@code POST /v1/projects/{id}/faqs},
 * {@code PATCH /v1/faqs/{id}}, {@code DELETE /v1/faqs/{id}} and
 * {@code PATCH /v1/projects/{id}/faqs/reorder}. §4.7's CD-15.
 *
 * <p><strong>A separate controller from {@link PublicProjectFaqController}, on the same
 * path.</strong> Spring routes on the method and the filter chain permits only the
 * {@code GET} — the same split {@code ProjectUpdateController} makes for
 * {@code /v1/projects/{id}/updates}, and for the same reason: one class here requires a
 * bearer token and the other must not, and a reader should be able to tell which is
 * which without opening the security configuration.
 *
 * <p><strong>Two addressing shapes, as the reward module has.</strong> The collection
 * hangs off the campaign — a create needs to say which campaign, and an order is a
 * property of the list rather than of any entry — while a single entry is addressed by
 * its own identifier on a flat path. Repeating the campaign in
 * {@code /v1/projects/{id}/faqs/{faqId}} would be a second, redundant statement of where
 * the entry lives, and one a client could get wrong: nothing stops it naming a campaign
 * the entry does not belong to, and the endpoint would then have to decide which of the
 * two it believed.
 *
 * <p>Authorisation is not decided here. Every method passes the caller's identifier down
 * to {@code ProjectFaqService}, which asks {@code ProjectAccess} — the one place in the
 * service where "who may act on this campaign" is settled.
 *
 * <p><strong>No {@code Idempotency-Key} on any of these.</strong> §10.3 requires one on
 * payment mutations, and none of these is one. A retried create writes a second entry,
 * which is visible on the tab and something the creator can see and delete — unlike a
 * second charge.
