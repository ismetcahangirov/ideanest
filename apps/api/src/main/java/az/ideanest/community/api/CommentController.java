/**
 * Writing and removing comments. §10.2's three community writes:
 * {@code POST /v1/projects/{id}/comments}, {@code POST /v1/comments/{id}/reply} and
 * {@code DELETE /v1/comments/{id}}.
 *
 * <p><strong>A separate controller from {@link PublicCommentController}, sharing a
 * path.</strong> Spring routes on the method and the filter chain permits only the
 * {@code GET} — the same split {@code ProjectUpdateController} already makes, and for
 * the same reason: one class here requires a bearer token and the other must not, and a
 * reader should be able to tell which is which without opening the security
 * configuration.
 *
 * <p><strong>None of these three appears in {@code SecurityConfiguration}</strong>, so
 * all three fall through to the catch-all rule and require a bearer token from an
 * account that is not inside §17.4's deletion grace period. That is the enforceable
 * half of §3.1's "only backers of that project and its creator may comment"; the other
 * half, and why this release cannot ask it, is in {@code CommentService}.
 *
 * <p><strong>Rate limiting is here rather than in the service</strong>, following
 * {@code ContentReportController} and {@code AuthController}: it is about the transport
 * — a source address, a 429, a {@code Retry-After} — and the service should not have to
 * know it is being reached over HTTP.
 *
 * <p><strong>The two budgets are spent by posting and replying and not by
 * deleting.</strong> A comment box is the abuse surface (§17.3's "bot traffic:
 * challenge on registration and comment"); removing a comment writes one column on a
 * row the caller already owns or moderates, and rate limiting it would mean a creator
 * clearing a spam flood being stopped part way through by the control that exists to
 * stop the flood.
 *
 * <p><strong>One budget across both writes, not one each.</strong> Splitting them would
 * mean somebody who had spent their allowance on top-level comments could then spend a
 * second one on replies, which is the same flood arriving one level down.
 *
 * <p>Authorisation is not decided here. The caller's identifier goes down to
 * {@code CommentService}, which asks {@code ProjectAccess} — the one place in the
 * module where "who may act on this campaign" is settled.
