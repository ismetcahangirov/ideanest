/**
 * Writing, reading and removing comments. §4.9's C-01, C-02, C-03 and CD-14.
 *
 * <h2>Who may comment, and the one thing this release cannot ask</h2>
 *
 * <p>§3.1's matrix says a comment may be written by "backers of that project and its
 * creator", and marks both Guest and User as ❌. <strong>This release enforces the
 * first half and not the second, and that is a deviation rather than an
 * oversight.</strong> What it does enforce: a signed-in account — the route sits under
 * {@code SecurityConfiguration}'s catch-all, so an anonymous caller and an account
 * inside §17.4's deletion grace period are both refused — and a campaign the caller is
 * allowed to see at all, which is {@link PublicProjects} and therefore §6.1's nine
 * public states.
 *
 * <p>What it cannot enforce is "has this account an active pledge on this campaign".
 * That is a statement about {@code pledges}, and the pledge module's application layer
 * publishes no answer to it — {@code PublicBackers} counts backers and deliberately
 * exposes none of them (#209), and {@code PledgeConflicts#activePledgeOf} is a
 * {@code REQUIRES_NEW} read that exists for one moment after a constraint violation
 * and counts a five-minute {@code DRAFT} reservation as a backing. Reaching into
 * another module's tables is what {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} exists to prevent.
 *
 * <p><strong>So this fails open where {@code ProjectUpdateService} fails closed, and
 * the asymmetry is deliberate.</strong> A backers-only update withheld from a backer
 * is a promise kept too tightly and is recoverable; showing it to the public is not. A
 * comment box open to a signed-in non-backer costs spam, which is bounded by the rate
 * limiter, reportable through the moderation module, and removable by the campaign's
 * team — while a comments tab only the creator can write in is C-01 shipped switched
 * off. Closing it is one method on the pledge module's application layer and one line
 * here, and it is called out in the pull request rather than left to be discovered.
 *
 * <h2>Where the creator highlight comes from</h2>
 *
 * <p>C-02 asks for creator replies to be visually distinguished, and
 * {@link #actingForTheCampaign} is the only place that is decided: {@link ProjectAccess}
 * is asked whether this account may act for the campaign, at the moment of the write,
 * and the answer is stored on the row. It is never read from the request — a claim of
 * authority a client could make is a claim anybody can make — and never recomputed on
 * read, because a collaborator whose grant is revoked in March still spoke for the
 * campaign in February. V25's header has the third option and why it loses.
 *
 * <h2>Authorisation is the community module's existing one, unchanged</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code ProjectAccess#requireEditable} for "does this account act for the
 * campaign", exactly as {@code ProjectUpdateService} uses it and with the same
 * compromise: §7.2 defines a {@code RESPOND_TO_COMMENTS} capability and the
 * fine-grained form of that method takes a {@code Capability}, which lives in the
 * project module's {@code domain} package and is unreachable from here by
 * {@code ModuleBoundaryTests}. Matching the module's existing convention beats
 * inventing a second one.
