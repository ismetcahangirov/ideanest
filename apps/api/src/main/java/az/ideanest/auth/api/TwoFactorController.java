/**
 * Two-factor authentication: enrolling, confirming, completing a sign-in, and
 * switching it off.
 *
 * <p>§10.2 names {@code /2fa/enable} and {@code /2fa/verify}. Two more are here
 * because those two cannot honestly carry four operations:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>{@code /2fa/confirm}</strong> — {@code /2fa/verify} is
 *       unauthenticated by necessity, since the caller has no session yet, and
 *       confirming an enrolment must require a bearer token. One endpoint with
 *       two authentication models and a branch deciding which applies is
 *       exactly where a bypass hides.</li>
 *   <li><strong>{@code /2fa/disable}</strong> — switching a security control off
 *       is not the same operation as switching it on, and folding it into
 *       {@code /2fa/enable} would mean one handler where the difference between
 *       hardening an account and weakening it is a field in the body.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Every path is rate limited. A six-digit code is guessable by definition,
 * and the count of attempts is the only thing that makes it not worth trying.
