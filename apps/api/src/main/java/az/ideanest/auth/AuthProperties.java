 * @param passwordMinLength minimum password length. Length is the only property
 *     that reliably resists guessing; composition rules mostly produce
 *     {@code Password1!} and a written-down note.
 * @param passwordMaxLength an upper bound, because the hash is deliberately
 *     expensive and an unbounded input is a denial of service against ourselves.
 * @param argon2 hashing parameters.
 * @param rateLimit how many attempts, and over what window.
 * @param token access and refresh token lifetimes and signing keys.
 * @param twoFactor time-based one-time passwords.
 * @param oauth the identity providers a person may sign in with.
 * @param refreshCookie how the refresh token is delivered to a browser.
 * @param logVerificationLinks whether to write verification links to the log.
