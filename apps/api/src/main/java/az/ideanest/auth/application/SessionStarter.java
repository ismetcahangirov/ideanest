/**
 * Turning "this person is who they say they are" into a session and a pair of
 * tokens.
 *
 * <p>Its own bean because two paths now reach it: a password on its own, and a
 * password followed by a second factor. Leaving it inside {@code SignInService}
 * and calling that from the two-factor path would have made the sign-in service
 * depend on the shape of a flow it does not run; copying it would have made
 * "how long is a refresh token" a thing with two answers.
 *
 * <p>{@code twoFactorProved} is recorded on the session rather than inferred
 * later from the account. An account can have two-factor switched on and still
 * hold sessions that were started before it was, and a payout action needs to
 * know what <em>this</em> sign-in proved.
