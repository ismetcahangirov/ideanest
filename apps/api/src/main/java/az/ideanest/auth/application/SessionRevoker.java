/**
 * Revoking a session so that the revocation survives the failure that caused
 * it.
 *
 * <p>This exists as its own bean for one reason: {@code REQUIRES_NEW}. When a
 * refresh detects a reused token, the correct response is to kill the session
 * <em>and</em> refuse the request — and refusing means throwing, which rolls
 * back the transaction the refresh is running in. Revoking in the same
 * transaction would therefore undo itself, and the attacker's next attempt
 * would find a live session. A separate transaction commits the revocation
 * before the caller throws.
 *
 * <p>Being a separate bean is not stylistic either: a self-invocation would not
 * pass through the proxy and the propagation would be silently ignored.
