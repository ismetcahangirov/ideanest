/**
 * The credentials on an account: the password, and the address that signs in —
 * §4.1's A-06, A-12 and A-13.
 *
 * <h2>Five paths, and why they are not two</h2>
 *
 * <p>§10.2 names the capabilities rather than the routes, and folding them
 * together fails the same way {@link TwoFactorController} says its four do:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>{@code /forgot-password} and {@code /reset-password}</strong> are
 *       both unauthenticated by necessity — the caller cannot sign in, which is
 *       the entire situation — while {@code /change-password} must require a
 *       bearer token. One handler with two authentication models and a branch
 *       deciding which applies is where a bypass hides.
 *   <li><strong>{@code /change-email} and {@code /confirm-email-change}</strong>
 *       are split for the same reason: the first requires a session and the
 *       current password, the second requires neither and is authorised entirely
 *       by the link it carries.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Every path is rate limited, and the keys differ on purpose</h2>
 *
 * <p>The two unauthenticated password paths are limited per source address
 * <em>and</em> per email address, the pair registration uses: a per-address limit
 * alone does not bound an attacker with many source addresses working on one
 * account, and a per-email limit alone does not bound one client working through
 * a list. The three authenticated paths are limited per account, because the
 * caller holds a token and the account is the thing being attacked — the same
 * argument {@link TwoFactorController#limitChanges} makes, and each attempt here
 * costs an Argon2 verification too.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing here is cacheable</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every response is {@code no-store}. Two of them are answers about a
 * credential and the rest are the outcome of changing one; an intermediary
 * holding any of them is holding a fact about an account's security state.
