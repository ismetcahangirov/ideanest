/**
 * What the six auth emails say.
 *
 * <p>The counterpart of {@code EmailComposer}, for the messages that are not
 * notifications. It reads {@code messages.properties} and produces a
 * {@link TransactionalMail}; it does not send anything, and it does not know how.
 *
 * <h2>No name in the greeting, and that is a decision</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code EmailComposer} opens with the recipient's name because a notification is
 * always about an account the platform already knows. Half of these are not: a
 * verification link goes to an address whose account is minutes old and may carry a name
 * somebody has not confirmed, and a message to an address with no account has nobody to
 * name at all. Looking one up would mean the auth module querying profiles to write
 * "Hello Aysel" on a password reset — a database round trip, a module dependency, and an
 * enumeration risk on the one endpoint that is careful never to say whether an address is
 * registered. So the copy addresses nobody by name and reads correctly in every case.
 *
 * <h2>Why there is no expiry in the wording</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every link here has a TTL and {@code AuthProperties} owns it, so putting "valid for
 * 24 hours" in the copy is either a second place the number lives or a placeholder. The
 * placeholder is worse than it looks: the reset link's TTL is one hour, so a single
 * sentence has to read correctly at {@code 1} and at {@code 24}, and Russian needs three
 * plural forms to do it. The copy says to ask for a new link if this one has expired,
 * which is true at every duration and is also the only sentence that tells the reader
 * what to <em>do</em>.
