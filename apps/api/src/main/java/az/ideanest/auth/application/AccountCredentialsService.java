/**
 * §4.1's A-12 and A-13: changing the password, and changing the address that signs in.
 *
 * <h2>One service, because both are the same act</h2>
 *
 * <p>Each of them replaces a credential, each of them requires the current password
 * first, and each of them ends by telling an address that something changed. Split in
 * two, the current-password check becomes two implementations of one rule, and the one
 * that is edited second is the one that stops matching.
 *
 * <h2>The current password is required, and it is not the access token</h2>
 *
 * <p>The caller is already authenticated — this is behind a bearer token — so the
 * password is a <em>second</em> check rather than the first, and it is what makes a
 * stolen access token useless for taking an account over. Fifteen minutes of somebody
 * else's token should not be able to move the address that resets the password, which
 * is the whole path an account takeover takes.
 *
 * <p>{@link IncorrectPasswordException} rather than an authentication failure, and the
 * user module's exception rather than a new one: the caller <em>is</em> authenticated,
 * and a 401 would send a client into signing them in again over a password they typed
 * into the wrong box.
 *
 * <h2>A-13 kills every session, and A-12 kills none</h2>
 *
 * <p>A password change revokes every session, including the one that made the request
 * — the reason {@code UserCredential} states, which is that a password is changed
 * precisely when somebody believes the old one is known, and leaving the sessions it
 * issued alive makes the change ceremonial. The client signs in again, which is the
 * correct amount of inconvenience.
 *
 * <p>An address change revokes nothing, because nothing about the credential changed.
 * The sessions were issued to the same person and the same password still opens them.
 *
 * <h2>The address does not move until the new one answers</h2>
 *
 * <p>V44 carries the argument at length: writing the new address immediately means one
 * typo puts the account behind a mailbox nobody can read, and sign-in — and the reset
 * that would fix it — both go to the address on the account. So the request is held in
 * {@code email_change_requests} and {@code users.email} moves in one statement when the
 * link is spent.
 *
 * <p><strong>Both addresses are written to</strong>, which is what the capability asks
 * for. The new one gets the link. The old one gets a notice with no link at all: it
 * cannot approve the change and does not need to, and what it is for is that somebody
 * losing their account finds out at the address they still hold.
