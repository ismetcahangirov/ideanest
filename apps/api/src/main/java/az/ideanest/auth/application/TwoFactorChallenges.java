/**
 * The second half of a sign-in: issuing the challenge, and spending it together
 * with a code.
 *
 * <p>Everything here answers a failure the same way, with
 * {@link AuthenticationFailedException} and one message. A challenge that never
 * existed, one that expired, one already spent, a wrong code, a replayed code,
 * a recovery code that was used last week — telling them apart would tell an
 * attacker which half of the pair they got right.
 *
 * <p><strong>Rate limiting is the control that matters here.</strong> A code is
 * six digits and three of them are valid at once across the skew window, so
 * without a limit an attacker with a stolen password guesses one in a few
 * hundred thousand attempts, which is minutes of scripting. The limit is per
 * challenge, and a challenge is retired when a new one is issued, so collecting
 * challenges does not buy more guesses.
