/**
 * {@link VerificationNotifier} over #86's transport, replacing the log line.
 *
 * <p>The stand-in this class removed said of itself that "without a real sender, a
 * deployed environment cannot complete registration". That is now false: the six messages
 * are composed by {@link AuthEmailComposer} and handed to {@link TransactionalMailer},
 * which renders them through the same layouts and sends them from the same envelope as
 * every notification.
 *
 * <h2>A refusal is logged, not propagated — and that is the trade</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code VerificationNotificationListener} runs {@code AFTER_COMMIT}. By the time any
 * method here is called the account exists, the password has already changed, or the
 * address change is already recorded — so an exception thrown from here cannot undo
 * anything. What it can do is turn a successful registration into a 500, after which the
 * person tries again and is told the address is taken, which is the worst of the
 * available outcomes.
 *
 * <p>So a refusal is an {@code ERROR} in the log and nothing else. <strong>The
 * consequence is real and is not hidden: during a mail outage people register and no link
 * arrives.</strong> They recover by asking for another one; what closes the window
 * properly is #135's outbox, which writes the intent to send in the same transaction as
 * the account and retries it until a relay takes it. This class is the shape that outbox
 * will drain, not a substitute for it.
 *
 * <h2>The local log line survives</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code ideanest.auth.log-verification-links} still writes the token itself, and is
 * still on in {@code local} and nowhere else. It is no longer a stand-in for sending —
 * the message goes to Mailpit as well — but it stays because reading a token out of the
 * log is how an integration test and a developer without a mail client follow a link. A
 * verification link in a production log is an account takeover for anybody who can read
 * logs, which is why the flag is not merely defaulted off but documented as local-only.
