/**
 * Assembles the whole of a pledge for a response — the add-on lines, the
 * post-campaign purchases, and their lines.
 *
 * <p><strong>One assembler rather than one per service</strong>, and #76 is what made
 * that necessary: a pledge is now four tables, {@code PledgeService} and
 * {@code PledgeSupplementService} both answer with the same shape, and two copies of
 * "read the pledge and everything hanging off it" is the arrangement in which one of
 * them quietly stops including the newest table. A backer who upgraded and then
 * confirmed would see their purchase on one endpoint and not on the next.
 *
 * <p>Called inside the caller's transaction and never on its own. {@code open-in-view}
 * is off, and the whole point of assembling here is that the reads happen while the
 * session is open.
