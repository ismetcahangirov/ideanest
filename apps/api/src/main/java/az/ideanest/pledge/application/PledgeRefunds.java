/**
 * The pledge's side of a full refund — IDN-EXT-01 (#40), §6.2's {@code COLLECTED → REFUNDED}.
 *
 * <p>Called by the payment module in the transaction that settles the refund, so the money, the
 * pledge and the campaign's totals move together. A pledge that is not {@code COLLECTED} — a
 * stored-card pledge of the retired model, or one already refunded — is left as it is.
 *
 * <p><strong>The pledge's row lock is what serialises its money (#171).</strong> Recording a refund,
 * settling one and applying a paid raise each take it first, before they read what the pledge was
 * charged and what went back. So a raise cannot be applied between a refund being decided and being
 * settled, two refunds settling on two charges at once cannot both see the other still in flight, and
 * whichever of them leaves nothing is the one that finds it so.
