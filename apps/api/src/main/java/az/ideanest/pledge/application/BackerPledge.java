/**
 * One of a backer's own pledges, as §4.8's list shows it — {@code GET /v1/me/pledges}.
 *
 * <p><strong>Not {@link PledgeDetail}, and the difference is what a list may cost.</strong>
 * That record is one pledge in full: the entity, its add-on lines, and §4.8's supplements,
 * each of them its own read. A page of twenty would be forty extra queries to render twenty
 * rows a backer is scrolling past. This is the projection a row needs, and the add-ons and
 * supplements stay where they already are — {@code GET /v1/pledges/{id}}, which is what a
 * client opens when the backer taps one.
 *
 * <p><strong>Every amount, though, and not just the total.</strong> The five §7.2 stores
 * plus the generated total, exactly as {@code PledgeResponse.Amounts} serves them, because
 * a list showing one number is a list a backer cannot reconcile against their card
 * statement — and because the alternative, showing the total alone, is the shape that makes
 * somebody add up the parts by hand and find they do not match. They are on the row already;
 * carrying them costs nothing.
 *
 * <p><strong>No backer identifier.</strong> There is only ever one, it is the caller, and a
 * response that echoed it back would be the one field a future endpoint could be tempted to
 * filter on from the request.
 *
 * @param state one of §6.2's twelve, by name
 * @param rewardTierId null on §4.5's PL-02, support with no reward
 * @param anonymous §4.5's PL-12, as the backer set it. On their own list because it is the
 *     only place they can check what they chose — the public archive shows this pledge to
 *     nobody when it is true, and a setting whose effect is invisible is a setting nobody
 *     trusts
 * @param latePledge §4.5's PL-16: whether this was taken after the campaign closed, in a
 *     window its creator reopened. Read from the row rather than derived from the
 *     campaign's state, which will have moved on by the time anybody looks
 * @param createdAt when the pledge was made. The key {@link BackerCursor} pages on, and it
 *     is not serialised: {@code confirmedAt} is the date a backer means, and a draft that
 *     was never confirmed has no date worth showing
