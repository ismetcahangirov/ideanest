/**
 * §4.7's CD-11 and §4.8's PM-17 (#79): the backer report, in a file a fulfilment partner
 * accepts.
 *
 * <h2>What is in the file, and what is missing from it</h2>
 *
 * <p>Eleven columns: who backed, how to reach them, which tier they took, what they paid,
 * which state the pledge is in, where it is going, and when. That is every fact the
 * platform currently holds about a backer of a running campaign.
 *
 * <p><strong>It does not carry a postal address, and that is a gap rather than a
 * decision.</strong> §4.8's PM-07 collects one after the campaign closes and #75 is the
 * issue that builds it; {@code pledges} has a {@code shipping_country} and no street. A
 * fulfilment partner will ask for the rest, and the answer today is that nobody has it —
 * which is a better answer than a column of blanks that looks like the backers declined to
 * say. The header row and this comment are where that is stated; when #75 lands, the
 * columns go in beside {@code shipping_country} and nothing else here changes.
 *
 * <h2>CSV, and the two ways CSV goes wrong</h2>
 *
 * <p><strong>Formula injection.</strong> A cell beginning {@code =}, {@code +}, {@code -}
 * or {@code @} is executed by Excel and by Sheets when the file is opened, and a campaign's
 * backers can choose their own display name. {@link #safe} prefixes those with an
 * apostrophe, which the spreadsheet strips on display and the parser does not execute. This
 * is not hypothetical: a display name is the most attacker-controlled string on the
 * platform, and the person who opens the file is the creator.
 *
 * <p><strong>Encoding.</strong> The document begins with a UTF-8 byte order mark, because
 * Excel on Windows reads a BOM-less UTF-8 file as the system code page and turns every
 * Azerbaijani name into mojibake. The BOM costs three bytes and is what makes the file
 * openable by the tool the recipients actually use.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is materialised rather than streamed</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the response has to be able to say {@link BackerExport#truncated()} in the
 * body it is describing, and a stream has already sent its first byte by the time it finds
 * out. The cap that makes this safe is
 * {@link PledgeProperties.Report#exportRowCap()}; the day a campaign is genuinely larger
 * than it, the answer is an asynchronous export with a download URL, which needs the media
 * module and is not this issue.
