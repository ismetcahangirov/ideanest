     * backers and one whose largest has forty thousand want different answers, and finding
     * that out should not need a release.

     *     Fifty, which is what fits a screen a creator scrolls rather than pages through
     * @param maxPageSize the largest page the report will build. A bound on the response
     *     rather than a preference: every row carries a name and an email address, so an
     *     unbounded page is an unbounded amount of personal data in one body
     * @param exportRowCap how many rows one export may contain. <strong>Fifty thousand
     *     is far beyond any campaign this platform has run</strong>, and the point of it is
     *     not the size — it is that the export knows when it hit the ceiling and says so in
     *     the response, rather than handing back a file that is quietly short
     * @param exportsPerAccount how many exports one account may take a window. Low, because
     *     an export is the single most valuable request a stolen token can make on this
     *     surface: it is every backer's name and email address in one file
