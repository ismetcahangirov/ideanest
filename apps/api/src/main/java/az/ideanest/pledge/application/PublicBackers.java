/**
 * How many people have backed this campaign, for a reader with no relationship to it.
 *
 * <p>§4.4 puts two of these on the project page: the backer count in the header, and a
 * backer count beside every tier on the Rewards tab. This is where both come from.
 *
 * <p><strong>Counts, and deliberately not a list of who.</strong> §4.4 makes backer
 * data public only in aggregate and never names an individual, so whether a campaign
 * should publish who backed it is a product and privacy decision nobody has taken —
 * it is #209, and it carries {@code status: needs-decision}. `CLAUDE.md` §5 says not
 * to implement around one of those, and a public endpoint publishing names is not
 * something to ship on the strength of a plausible default. {@link PublicBacker} is
 * what that decision will be built out of if it goes the other way; nothing here
 * consumes it yet, and that file says so.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why this is not a method on {@code PledgeService}.</strong> The same split
 * {@code PublicRewardCatalogue} makes against {@code RewardService}, for the same
 * reason. That service is the backer's own checkout: every entry point begins by
 * establishing who is calling, and {@code PledgeDetail} carries the amounts, the
 * shipping destination, the idempotency key, and the anonymity flag itself. This one
 * has no caller to establish — a visitor deciding whether to back a campaign has
 * usually not registered — and what stands in for authorisation is the campaign's
 * state. Folding a public read into a class whose every other method starts with an
 * ownership check is how a public read eventually inherits the wrong projection.
 *
 * <h2>Both counts come from one place</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link PublicBacking} carries the campaign's total and the per-tier totals
 * together, because they are one question. Answering them separately is how they come
 * to disagree, and the specific way they disagree is that somebody derives the
 * campaign's number by summing the tiers — which silently omits §4.5's PL-02, the
 * pledges that took no reward at all.
 *
 * <p><strong>Not {@code projects.backers_count}</strong>, and that is worth stating
 * plainly. The denormalised counter exists (V6) and discovery reads it, but nothing on
 * the platform writes it yet, so today it is zero for every campaign. The count served
 * here is taken from {@code pledges}, which is the ledger and therefore the answer.
 * When something starts maintaining the counter, the two must be reconciled — and the
 * test that reconciles them belongs with whichever issue starts the writing.

     * <p><strong>Derived from {@link PledgeState#ACTIVE}, minus {@link
     * PledgeState#DRAFT}</strong>, rather than written out. The active set is §7.2's
     * "one pledge per backer per project" and it is the same six states
     * {@code pledges_project_backer_active_key} enforces; restating five of them here
     * would be a second list to keep in step with a state machine that still has
     * transitions to gain (#56, epic #59). Derivation means the only thing this class
     * can get wrong is the one deliberate difference, which is stated once, here.
     *
     * <p><strong>And the difference is DRAFT.</strong> A draft is a reservation with a
     * five-minute life (§4.5's PL-13), not a commitment. Counting one would make the
     * public backer count rise every time somebody opened a checkout and fall again
     * when they wandered off. {@code CHARGE_FAILED} stays in: §5.1 is still retrying
     * it and the backer is still committed.
