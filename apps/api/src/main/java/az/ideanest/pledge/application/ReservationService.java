/**
 * Holds a limited reward's place for the backer who is checking out, for as long
 * as §4.5 gives them to finish.
 *
 * <p><strong>The reservation is a DRAFT pledge.</strong> §6.2 already says so —
 * {@code [*] -> DRAFT}, and {@code DRAFT -> EXPIRED: reservation TTL} — so what
 * this class creates is a row in {@code pledges} whose existence is the claim on
 * the stock. V17's header carries the argument for why that lives in PostgreSQL
 * rather than in the Redis key §4.5's capability table mentions; the short version
 * is that taking the place and recording who took it have to be one transaction,
 * and across two datastores they are not.
 *
 * <p><strong>What makes it correct is one statement, not this class.</strong>
 * {@link RewardStock#reservePlaces} is a conditional {@code UPDATE} that takes
 * PostgreSQL's row lock and re-reads the counts behind it, so two checkouts racing
 * for the last places are serialised by the database. Everything here is ordering
 * and error messages. If this code is wrong, V7's
 * {@code reward_tiers_stock_is_within_the_limit} refuses the transaction rather
 * than letting the tier oversell — which is the property {@code ReservationTests}
 * exercises with real threads against a real PostgreSQL, because it is the only
 * way to find out.
 *
 * <p><strong>The order of the three writes is deliberate.</strong> The caller's
 * own stale draft is settled first, then the place is taken, then the pledge is
 * inserted. Taking the place before inserting means a failure of the insert rolls
 * the place back inside the same transaction; inserting first would leave a window
 * in which a draft exists that holds nothing, and it is the drafts that the sweep
 * counts.
 *
 * <p><strong>#52 added {@link #draft}, and it is now the checkout's way in.</strong>
 * {@link #reserve} is what #51 built — a place, priced at the tier — and it remains
 * the smallest statement of what a reservation is, which is what
 * {@code ReservationTests} drives. The new method prices the whole of §4.5's PL-01
 * to PL-06 before it takes anything, and then takes the place and writes the row
 * through the same three steps. Both go through {@link #hold}; the difference
 * between them is only how much has been decided by the time the row is written.
 *
 * <p><strong>#56 added {@link #edit}, which is the only method here that moves
 * places rather than taking or giving them.</strong> It takes the new places before
 * releasing the old, so that a backer whose edit is refused still holds what they
 * already had; that ordering is the single most important line in this class and its
 * javadoc carries the argument. It also re-quotes through the same
 * {@link #selectionFor} the checkout uses, so a draft and an edit of that draft
 * cannot come to two different totals for one selection.
 *
 * <p><strong>#203 made the add-ons hold stock too, and turned "the place" into
 * "the places".</strong> An add-on is a {@code reward_tiers} row with
 * {@code is_addon} set (V7), so it carries {@code limit_quantity},
 * {@code claimed_quantity} and {@code reserved_quantity} exactly as a selectable tier
 * does and {@code reward_tiers_stock_is_within_the_limit} applies to it — and until
 * #203 nothing ever wrote those counters for one, so two backers could each take the
 * last of a limited add-on and the constraint could not see it, because the count it
 * guards never moved. What a pledge holds is now a map from tier to a number of
 * places — see {@link HeldPlaces}, which also carries why the map is sorted — and
 * every path below moves one of those: the draft takes them, {@link #confirm} moves
 * them from reserved to claimed, {@link #cancel} gives them back,
 * {@link #edit} takes the difference and releases the difference, and
 * {@link ReservationExpiry} walks {@code pledge_addons} when a draft lapses. The
 * reward tier is a line in the same map with a quantity of one, so there is one rule
 * rather than a rule and an exception.
 *
 * <p><strong>What is not here.</strong>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Whether the campaign will take a pledge at all.</strong> A
 *       reservation on a campaign that is not live, or one past its deadline
 *       without late pledging enabled, is a request that should never reach this
 *       far. That is a question about {@code projects}, which is another module's
 *       state machine, and it belongs with the endpoint that has already loaded
 *       the campaign to render it (#52). Checking it here would mean this module
 *       depending on the project module in order to say no twice — so #52 put it
 *       in {@link PledgeService}, one call above this one, and this class still
 *       names nothing in {@code az.ideanest.project}.
 *   <li><strong>§10.3's {@code Idempotency-Key}.</strong> Recorded on the row, and
 *       enforced a layer above by {@code shared.idempotency}. Nothing here is
 *       replay-safe on its own, and it does not need to be: the machinery runs this
 *       at most once per key.
 *   <li><strong>Whether a tier the backer named as an add-on really is one.</strong>
 *       Nothing here reads {@code is_addon}, so a client that sent a reward tier in
 *       the {@code addons} list holds places on it and is quoted for them. That is
 *       the behaviour #52 shipped and #203 has not changed; what #203 changes is that
 *       the places are now genuinely held either way, so the count and the pledges
 *       agree whichever the client meant.
 * </ul>

     * and if the take then fails — the new tier sold its last place a moment ago —
     * they have lost the reward they already had in exchange for one they never got.
     * Taking first means the worst case is a refusal that changes nothing, which is
     * what a failed edit ought to be. The cost is that a backer switching between two
     * tiers momentarily holds a place on each, so a tier can refuse a switch it would
     * have allowed had the release come first; that is a refusal somebody can retry,
     * and losing a reservation is not.

     * <p>The whole method is one transaction, so the take, the release, the re-quote
     * and the add-on rows either all happen or none do. That is what lets the
     * refusal above be a genuine no-op rather than a promise.
     *
     * <p><strong>Which column moves depends on the pledge, not on the tier.</strong>
     * A {@code DRAFT} holds <em>reserved</em> places and a {@code CONFIRMED} pledge
     * holds <em>claimed</em> ones, so an edit moves like for like — see
     * {@link RewardStock#claimPlaces} and

     *
     * <p><strong>An add-on's quantity moves the difference, in the same two
     * passes (#203).</strong> The places the pledge holds before and after are two
     * maps, and the edit is their difference: raising a quantity from two to three
     * takes one place, lowering it to one gives one back, and dropping the add-on
     * gives back all of them. Only the difference moves, so an edit that changes a
     * destination and nothing else issues no stock statement at all — and the

     * confirmed pledge — is §7.2's one-per-backer rule and they are told about it.
     * A draft whose five minutes have run out is released here and now, rather than
     * when the sweep next runs: the backer is the person whose reservation it was,
     * and making them wait up to a minute to be allowed to try again would be a
     * refusal caused entirely by our own scheduling.
     *
     * <p>Racing another request that is doing the same thing is safe in both
     * branches. The release is a conditional update that exactly one caller wins,
     * and if this read misses a pledge that another transaction is inserting,
     * {@code pledges_project_backer_active_key} refuses the second insert. This
     * read decides what to say; the index decides what is true.
     *
     * <p><strong>And when the index is the one that decides, it says the same
     * thing.</strong> {@link #insert} translates that one constraint into the same
     * {@link PledgeAlreadyExistsException} raised here, so a backer who
     * double-clicked cannot tell which of the two paths refused them. Before that
     * translation the race reached them as a 500.
