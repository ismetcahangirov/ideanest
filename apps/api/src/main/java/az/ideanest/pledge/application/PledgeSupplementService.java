/**
 * §4.8's PM-09, PM-10 and PM-16 (#76): what a backer buys after the campaign closed.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not an edit</h2>
 *
 * <p>§4.5's PL-09 already lets a backer change what they are buying, and it re-quotes
 * the whole pledge. That is right while the campaign runs, because nothing has been
 * charged and the total is a promise about a future charge. After the deadline it is
 * wrong twice over, and V39 argues both at length: §5.1's decision was taken against
 * those numbers and V29 froze it, so moving {@code base_amount} afterwards changes
 * what a campaign is reported to have raised; and the money moves separately, which is
 * the issue's own requirement — an additional purchase is "charged as a separate
 * transaction".
 *
 * <p>So the two endpoints here are refused while the campaign is still taking pledges,
 * with a code that sends the client to the edit instead. One way to change a pledge at
 * a time, and the one that applies is decided by the campaign rather than by the
 * client.
 *
 * <h2>What actually changes</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>The pledge's reward tier moves</strong> on an upgrade, because that is
 *       what will be shipped, and its claimed place moves with it. Its
 *       {@code base_amount} does not.
 *   <li><strong>The purchase is recorded beside the pledge</strong> as a
 *       {@link PledgeSupplement}, with its own lines for add-ons. Nothing is written
 *       into {@code pledge_addons} — V39 says why a mixed line would be unpickable.
 *   <li><strong>Nothing is charged.</strong> PM-16 is the charge and it is epic #59's;
 *       {@code collected_at} is null on every row this platform holds. A stub that
 *       marked a supplement collected would tell a creator money had arrived.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>What a fulfilment has to read</h2>
 *
 * <p>Both tables. What goes in a backer's box is {@code pledge_addons} plus every
 * {@code supplement_addons} row on their pledge, and a reader that took only the first
 * would pack the campaign's add-ons and leave out everything bought in the pledge
 * manager. It is stated here, in V39, and in §4.8, because it is the one cost of
 * keeping the two purchases apart.
