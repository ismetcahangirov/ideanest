/**
 * §8.4's {@code reservation-cleaner}, every minute: gives back the places held by
 * checkouts nobody finished.
 *
 * <p><strong>This is the price of not using a Redis TTL</strong>, and it is the
 * whole of it. PostgreSQL has no expiry, so a reservation lapses because a job
 * notices that it has — see V17 for why the reservation lives in the database
 * anyway. §8.4 lists this job, so the sweep is the design rather than a workaround
 * for it, and it buys something back: an expired reservation is a row with a state
 * and a history rather than a key that silently stopped existing.
 *
 * <p><strong>On the durable scheduler since #134</strong>, which means the trigger
 * claims a lease and exactly one replica sweeps. This job did not need that to be
 * correct: {@link ReservationExpiry#release} claims each row with a conditional
 * update, so two replicas sweeping at once already credited the tier once. What it
 * gains is that they no longer both read the same batch of lapsed drafts a minute —
 * and what the platform gains is that a sweep which starts failing now backs off and
 * says so, rather than throwing into a log once a minute for ever.
 *
 * <p>A minute late here is a minute in which a limited tier looks sold out while a
 * place is actually free: a lost sale rather than a wrong one, which is why this was
 * tolerable on an unclaimed timer and would not have been for anything that moves
 * money.
