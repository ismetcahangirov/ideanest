/**
 * A pledge and everything that belongs to it, read together.
 *
 * <p>Four tables are one thing to a client, and assembling them here rather than in
 * the controller is what keeps the read inside a transaction: {@code open-in-view} is
 * off, so a response built from a lazily loaded association outside the service layer
 * is a response built from a closed session.
 *
 * <p>The entities themselves rather than a copy of their fields. The boundary this
 * respects is the module one — {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} lets a module's
 * {@code api} package see its own {@code domain} — and interposing a second set of
 * records between the entity and the response would be a third place for the six
 * amounts to be listed and a third place to get one of them wrong.
 *
 * @param addons what the campaign's pledge selected. Priced inside
 *     {@code pledges.addons_amount}
 * @param supplements §4.8's PM-09 and PM-10 (#76): what was bought after the campaign
 *     closed, each charged separately from the pledge and none of them charged yet
 * @param supplementAddons the lines of those purchases, across all of them. Flat
 *     rather than nested inside each supplement, because they are read in one query
 *     for the whole pledge — the response is what groups them
