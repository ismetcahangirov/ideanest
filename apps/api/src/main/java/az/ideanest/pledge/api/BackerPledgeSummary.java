/**
 * One of a backer's own pledges, on the wire — §10.2's {@code GET /v1/me/pledges} (#287).
 *
 * <p><strong>A summary and not {@link PledgeResponse}.</strong> That record is the shape of
 * all three checkout endpoints and carries the add-on lines, §4.8's supplements, the
 * shipping destination, the payment method and the reservation clock; a page of twenty
 * would be forty extra reads to render twenty rows somebody is scrolling. What is dropped
 * is what a client fetches when the backer opens one, from the endpoint that already serves
 * it. What is <em>not</em> dropped is the campaign, because a pledge list whose rows say
 * only "45,00 ₼, CONFIRMED" is a list nobody can use.
 *
 * <p><strong>The amounts are {@link PledgeResponse.Amounts}, reused rather than
 * restated.</strong> Six values in one order, one serialisation, one place to change: a
 * second amounts record would be the one that gains a field late, and the difference would
 * show as a backer's total on the list disagreeing with the total on the pledge they tapped.
 *
 * <p><strong>Nulls are written out</strong>, following {@link PledgeResponse} and for its
 * reason: a support-only pledge has no {@code rewardTierId}, a pledge that was never
 * confirmed has no {@code confirmedAt}, and an absent key cannot be told from a value the
 * client failed to parse.
 *
 * @param state one of §6.2's twelve, by name. All twelve appear: a backer's own list shows
 *     the pledge they cancelled and the one whose card was refused, which is what they
 *     opened it to find
 * @param rewardTitle what the tier is called, or null — for §4.5's PL-02, support with no
 *     reward, and for a tier the campaign has since deleted. The two are deliberately not
 *     distinguished: to the reader they are the same row
 * @param isAnonymous §4.5's PL-12, as the backer set it. On their own list because it is
 *     the only place they can check what they chose — the public archive shows this pledge
 *     to nobody when it is true
 * @param latePledge §4.5's PL-16: taken after the campaign closed, in a window its creator
 *     reopened
 * @param project null when the campaign row no longer exists. The pledge is still served: it
 *     is the backer's money, and it is still theirs when the thing they backed has been
 *     removed

     * somebody's own pledge, where what is being reported is the pledge. The campaign's
     * progress is one tap away on its own page, and putting it here would make a backer's
     * private list a place to watch other people's numbers move.
     *
     * <p>Both slugs, because §10.2's public campaign page is
     * {@code /projects/{creatorSlug}/{projectSlug}} and one of them alone addresses nothing.
