/**
 * What a client sends to {@code PATCH /v1/pledges/{id}}, with JSON Merge-Patch
 * semantics (RFC 7396).
 *
 * <p>{@link DraftPledgeRequest}'s fields minus {@code projectId} and minus
 * {@code referrerCode}. A pledge backs the campaign it was made for, so moving it is
 * not an edit; and a referrer is a record of which link brought the backer, which is
 * a fact about how they arrived and not a preference they can revise.
 * {@code paymentMethodId} is here and is not on the draft, because §4.5 has the card
 * chosen after the draft exists.
 *
 * <p><strong>Absent and null are different, and on this endpoint the difference is
 * money.</strong> {@code "rewardTierId": null} gives up the reward and makes the
 * pledge support-only (PL-02); leaving it out keeps the reward. Bound to an ordinary
 * record the two arrive identically, and a client raising its contribution would
 * silently strip the reward off the pledge. {@link Patched} is what keeps them
 * apart, and {@code EditPledge} carries the same note for the application layer.
 *
 * <p>Bean validation annotations are absent for {@code RewardPatchRequest}'s reason:
 * they cannot see inside a {@link Patched}, and a rule enforced both here and in the
 * service would be two rules that can disagree. What is checked here is only what
 * this type can check alone — the shape of a country code — and the rest is the
 * value objects' and the service's.
