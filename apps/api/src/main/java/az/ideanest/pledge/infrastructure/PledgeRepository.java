     * made correct, because two collection runs read the same pledge, both conclude it
     * is theirs, and both charge a card. {@code SKIP LOCKED} rather than a wait, so
     * replicas divide the queue instead of one of them sitting behind a provider call
     * that has not returned.

     * <p><strong>One row at a time, and the transaction that takes it is the transaction
     * that charges.</strong> The lock therefore covers the provider call, which is
     * deliberate and is the whole of what stops a pledge being charged twice: everything
     * about one pledge is serialised, including a re-poll of a charge the provider has
     * not decided. What it costs is a connection held for the duration of an HTTP call,
     * which is why the pass is bounded and why the provider has a short timeout.
     *
     * <p>The state is a parameter because the two jobs claim different sets — §8.4's
     * {@code charge-processor} takes {@code CHARGE_PENDING}, the initial collection, and
     * {@code charge-retry} takes {@code CHARGE_FAILED}, §9.6's retries. Two queues, two
     * schedules, and neither can starve the other.
     *
     * <p><strong>A pledge at or past its window is never claimed, and that predicate is
     * what bounds §9.6 at four attempts.</strong> The schedule has to answer "when is the
     * next attempt" even after the last one — V42 refuses a queued pledge with no
     * {@code next_charge_attempt_at} — and the honest answer it gives is the moment the
     * pledge will be dropped. Without this line that answer would be a fifth attempt, made
     * at the instant the window closes and one slot beyond anything §9.6 allows.
     *
     * <p>It is also the right rule on its own. A pledge left queued for seven days by an
     * outage must not be charged on the eighth day: by then the backer has been told for
     * five days that this was the last attempt, and the campaign has been reported to its
     * creator as short by that amount. Expressing it in the claim rather than in the sweep
     * means neither job can forget it, and the ordering between charging and dropping
     * inside a pass stops mattering.
