/**
 * Who has backed a campaign, published so that other modules need not read {@code pledges}.
 *
 * <p>The pledge module's half of #245. {@code ProjectAudiences} is the question and this is the
 * only class that answers {@code BACKERS}, because {@code pledges} is this module's table and
 * {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} forbids anybody else from naming it. Before this existed, §4.10's
 * "goal reached" notified the creator and nobody else — the least useful half of that event,
 * since the people who funded the campaign heard nothing.
 *
 * <p><strong>It implements {@code ProjectAudienceSource} rather than {@code ProjectAudiences}
 * itself, and #90 is why.</strong> {@code saves} and {@code follows} live in the community
 * module, so this is no longer the only module that owns an audience — and one port with two
 * implementations is an injection failure rather than a design. {@code RoutedProjectAudiences}
 * is the single bean callers ask, and {@link #answers()} below is this module's claim on the
 * one audience it can answer.
 *
 * <h2>Which states are backers, and why it is not the active set</h2>
 *
 * <p>V17 defines an <em>active</em> pledge as one of six states, and this is five of them:
 * {@code CONFIRMED}, {@code CHARGE_PENDING}, {@code CHARGE_FAILED}, {@code COLLECTED},
 * {@code FULFILLED}.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code DRAFT} is in V17's active set and is deliberately not a backer.</strong> The
 * two definitions are answering different questions. V17's exists to stop one person holding two
 * places on a limited tier, so a checkout in progress has to count. This one decides who gets
 * told the campaign reached its goal, and somebody who opened a checkout and did not finish it
 * has not backed anything — telling them would be a message about a commitment they never made,
 * and on a "campaign succeeded" notification it would be a message implying their card is about
 * to be charged.
 *
 * <p>The six states V17 leaves out are left out here for its reason and it is the same one: the
 * commitment has ended. A lapsed reservation, either cancellation, a dropped charge, a refund and
 * a chargeback are all people who are no longer backing this campaign, and a notification about
 * its progress is not theirs.
 *
 * <h2>SQL rather than the repository</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code PledgeRepository} maps entities and this needs one column from up to thousands of
 * rows. Loading an aggregate per backer to read its {@code backer_id} would be the version of
 * this that is correct and unusable on the campaign where it matters most.
 *
 * <p>Ordered by the identifier so that the answer is <em>stable</em>, which is the property the
 * interface promises and the only one it promises: the caller's bound can cut the list short, and
 * a truncation that returned a different subset on every call would mean a retried event told a
 * different set of people. Note that stable is not the same as ascending in
 * {@code UUID.compareTo}'s ordering — PostgreSQL compares a {@code uuid} by its bytes and Java
 * compares it as two signed longs, so the two disagree on about half of all pairs. Nothing here
 * or above depends on which; a caller that started to would be depending on the storage engine.
 *
 * <h2>{@code @Component} rather than {@code @Repository}</h2>
 *
 * <p>Which is unlike {@code NotificationRecipients} beside it, and the reason is the argument
 * check below. Spring translates exceptions out of a {@code @Repository} bean, and it translates
 * an {@code IllegalArgumentException} into {@code InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException} — so a
 * caller that asked for an audience of nobody would be handed a {@code DataAccessException}
 * saying the database refused something it was never shown. The stereotype buys nothing else
 * here: this class throws no persistence exception worth translating, because it runs one
 * {@code SELECT} that either works or is an outage.
