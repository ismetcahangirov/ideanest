/**
 * A backer's own pledges, and the campaigns their public archive may name.
 *
 * <p><strong>SQL rather than JPA, following {@code BackedPledgeFacts} and
 * {@code BackerListRepository}</strong> and for their reason: both questions are a
 * projection over a state filter with a keyset predicate on it, and loading entities to
 * build a record out of would fetch an idempotency key, a version, a collection schedule
 * and a retry count per row on a read whose whole purpose is to render a list.
 *
 * <h2>{@code projects} is not joined, and that is the point</h2>
 *
 * <p>Both of these lists render a campaign card beside every row, and neither query
 * mentions {@code projects}. That table belongs to the project module;
 * {@code SavedListResponse} names reading it from outside as the reason its own response
 * carries no cover image, no funding total and no deadline, and refuses to close the gap
 * that way. So these queries answer with identifiers and
 * {@code az.ideanest.project.application.ProfileCampaigns} turns them into cards — one
 * extra indexed read per page, bounded by the page size, which is what the boundary costs.
 *
 * <p>{@code reward_tiers} is not joined either, for the same reason and with a precedent
 * three files away: {@code BackerListRepository} says so about the creator's report, and
 * {@code RewardTitles} is the interface the reward module publishes instead.
 *
 * <h2>Two page queries rather than one with a nullable cursor</h2>
 *
 * <p>The first page and the pages after it are separate statements, as in
 * {@code ProfileCampaignRows}: PostgreSQL cannot infer the type of a bound {@code NULL} in
 * a row-value comparison, so the single-statement form needs a cast at every occurrence and
 * hands the planner a predicate it cannot use as a range scan. The comparison itself is
 * {@code (p.created_at, p.id) < (:at, :id)}, which expresses "strictly after this row in
 * this ordering" without spelling the tie-break out as a second disjunct — and a
 * hand-written disjunct is how a keyset page comes to drop the row on the boundary.
