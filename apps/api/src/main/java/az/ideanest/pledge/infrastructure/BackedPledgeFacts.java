/**
 * {@link BackedPledges} against {@code pledges}.
 *
 * <p><strong>SQL rather than JPA</strong>, following {@code PledgeProjectAudiences}
 * and for the same reason: the question is a projection of four columns over a state
 * filter, and loading entities to build a record out of would fetch six amounts and
 * an idempotency key per row on a query whose whole purpose is to be cheap enough to
 * run over a campaign's entire backer list.
 *
 * <p>The state list is the same one {@code PledgeProjectAudiences} uses and is
 * copied rather than shared, which is a decision worth naming. Extracting it would
 * mean a constant in {@code shared} that both read — and "which states are a
 * backing" is §6.2's rule about this module's own table, not a platform vocabulary.
 * What keeps the two honest is that they are three lines apart in the same package
 * and {@code ComputedAudienceTests} would notice one of them drifting.
