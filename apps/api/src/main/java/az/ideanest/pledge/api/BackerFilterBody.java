/**
 * A backer filter in a request body: §4.7's CD-10 axes, as JSON.
 *
 * <p><strong>The same four axes the query string carries</strong>, in the one shape the
 * export and the segment endpoints both take. Having the export accept a query string and
 * the segment a body would be two spellings of one idea, and the first thing that would
 * drift between them is what an omitted field means.
 *
 * <p>Every field is optional and <strong>absent means "any"</strong>, matching
 * {@link BackerFilter}. An empty array means the same thing rather than "match nothing":
 * a client that removed the last chip from a filter row has stopped filtering by it, and
 * a body that meant "no backers at all" would be a screen that mysteriously emptied.
 *
 * <p>The bounds here are the same numbers {@link BackerFilter} enforces, declared as
 * annotations so that an over-long list is a 400 from the framework with a field name in
 * it rather than a message assembled by hand. The value object still checks: a caller that
 * reaches it another way is not exempt from the rule.
 *
 * @param states which pledge states count, from the five the report covers
 * @param rewardTierIds which tiers
 * @param countries ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 destinations, in any case
 * @param term a name or an email address, or part of one
