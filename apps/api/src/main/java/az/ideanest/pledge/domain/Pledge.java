/**
 * What a backer commits to — and, while it is a {@link PledgeState#DRAFT}, the
 * reservation that holds a limited reward's place for them.
 *
 * <p><strong>A draft is the reservation.</strong> §6.2 gives the state machine
 * {@code [*] -> DRAFT} and {@code DRAFT -> EXPIRED: reservation TTL}, so there is
 * no separate reservation record to keep in step with this one: the row that says
 * what the backer is buying is the row that holds the stock, and
 * {@link #getReservationExpiresAt()} is when it stops. V17 has the argument for
 * why that lives in PostgreSQL rather than in a Redis key, which is what §4.5's
 * capability table says.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@link Version}, not a row lock.</strong> Two writers to one pledge
 * are ordinary — the sweep expiring a draft while its owner confirms it, a backer
 * editing in one tab and confirming in another — and the loser has something
 * useful to do about it, which is to re-read and tell the backer their
 * reservation lapsed. A pessimistic lock would instead hold a row across a
 * checkout that is waiting on a human being and a payment provider.
 *
 * <p>What this version does <em>not</em> do is keep the stock count correct. That
 * is a conditional {@code UPDATE} on {@code reward_tiers} and V7's
 * {@code reward_tiers_stock_is_within_the_limit} — a version on this row cannot
 * say anything about a place on another one.
 *
 * <p><strong>The total is the database's.</strong> {@code total_amount} is a
 * generated column, mapped read-only, so it cannot disagree with the parts it is
 * made of. Every amount is {@link BigDecimal} against {@code numeric(14,2)}: this
 * is the number a card is charged.
 *
 * <p><strong>What is deliberately absent</strong> is every transition except the
 * ones that are built. #51 owns nothing to {@link PledgeState#DRAFT} and
 * {@code DRAFT} to {@link PledgeState#EXPIRED}; #52 adds {@link #confirm}, which is
 * §6.2's {@code DRAFT --> CONFIRMED}; #56 adds {@link #edit}, which moves no state at
 * all, and {@link #cancelByBacker}, which is {@code CANCELED_BY_BACKER}; #103 adds
 * {@link #cancelByProject}, which is what a halted campaign does to every pledge on
 * it; #76 adds {@link #upgradeTo}, which moves no state at all.
 *
 * <p><strong>#64 and #65 add the collection edges</strong> —
 * {@link #queueForCollection}, {@link #collected}, {@link #chargeFailed} and
 * {@link #dropped}, which are §6.2's {@code CONFIRMED → CHARGE_PENDING → COLLECTED},
 * the {@code CHARGE_FAILED} loop between them, and the {@code DROPPED} that ends it.
 * {@link #chargeUnresolved} is not on that diagram and moves no state: it is a
 * provider that has taken the instruction and not answered, which §9.6 has no row for
 * because §9.6 is about cards that were refused.
 *
 * <p>The refund of an already-collected pledge (#67) and the chargeback (#68) are
 * still absent, and setters that let any caller move the state would be a state
 * machine with no rules in it.
