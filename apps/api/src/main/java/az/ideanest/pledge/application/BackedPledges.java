/**
 * "Which pledges are a backing, and whose are they" — the pledge module's answer to
 * the pledge manager.
 *
 * <p>The fourth published contract of {@code ModuleBoundaryTests}' shape, after
 * {@code ProjectCapability}, {@code ProjectAudiences} and {@code ProjectSummaries},
 * and it exists for the reason all three do. §4.8 is entirely about pledges — a
 * survey goes to the backers of a campaign, an address belongs to one pledge, and
 * what a backer is asked depends on the tier they chose — and the pledge manager may
 * not read {@code pledges}. The wrong answers were the usual two: reach into
 * {@code pledge.domain}, which the boundary test fails the build over, or copy the
 * rows, which is a second set of pledge states free to disagree with the first.
 *
 * <p><strong>Declared here rather than in {@code shared}</strong>, unlike
 * {@code ProjectAudiences}. That one is published in {@code shared} because two
 * modules answer it and a third asks; this has one answerer and one asker, both
 * named, and putting it in {@code shared} would mean {@code shared} acquiring a
 * vocabulary about pledge states — which is a feature, and {@code shared} does not
 * get features. {@code RewardStock} is declared in the reward module for the same
 * reason and read by the pledge module.
 *
 * <p><strong>It answers about backings, never about drafts.</strong> A draft is a
 * checkout in progress; it holds stock and it may expire in twenty minutes. Surveying
 * one, or accepting an address for one, would be asking somebody to fill in a form
 * about a purchase they have not made.
