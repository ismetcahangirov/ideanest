     * {@link #DRAFT} is a checkout in progress: changing it is what the backer is in
     * the middle of doing, and withdrawing it is abandoning a purchase nobody has
     * been charged for. A {@link #CONFIRMED} pledge is PL-09's real case — the backer
     * committed, the campaign is still running, and they have changed their mind
     * about the tier or the destination. §9.7 puts cancellation in the same place:
     * "backer changes their mind while live — cancel, nothing was collected".
     *
     * <p><strong>Every other state is out, and none of them is an oversight.</strong>

     * states are not active. {@link #CHARGE_PENDING} onwards are past the campaign's
     * close, where money is moving or has moved: changing the amount then is a
     * refund or a second charge, which is #67's and epic #59's, not an edit.
     *
     * <p><strong>This set is half of the rule, not the whole of it.</strong> The
     * other half is the campaign — PL-09 says "until the deadline" — and it cannot
     * be stated here, because whether a campaign is still taking pledges is a fact
     * about {@code projects} and this module may not read it.
