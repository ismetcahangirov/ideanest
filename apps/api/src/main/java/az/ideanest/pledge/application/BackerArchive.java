/**
 * What somebody has backed — §4.2's P-04 archive (#274), and §4.8's own pledge list (#287).
 *
 * <p><strong>Two lists over one table, and they are not the same list.</strong> One is
 * public and is somebody else's page; the other is behind a bearer token and is the
 * caller's own. Everything that differs between them is a privacy rule, and each of them is
 * stated once, here:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>No amounts on the archive.</strong> §4.2's P-04 makes the backed tab a list
 *       of campaigns and never a list of pledges. How much somebody gave is between them,
 *       the creator and the platform, and a profile page that published it would let anyone
 *       who could guess a slug read a stranger's spending. The guarantee is structural
 *       rather than remembered: {@link #backedBy} returns
 *       {@link ProfileCampaign} — the same card the created tab renders — and there is
 *       nowhere in it for a number to go. {@code PublicBacker} takes the same shape for
 *       PL-12, and says why that is stronger than filtering.
 *   <li><strong>Anonymous pledges are absent from the archive.</strong> §4.5's PL-12, and it
 *       is applied in the statement rather than after it — see {@code BackerArchiveRows}.
 *       A backer who asked not to be named on a campaign has not agreed to be named on
 *       their own profile instead, which is the same page, one link away.
 *   <li><strong>Only the states that are a backing.</strong> {@link PublicBackers#COUNTED},
 *       reused rather than restated: a draft is a five-minute reservation (§4.5's PL-13),
 *       and an archive that counted one would list a campaign somebody opened a checkout on
 *       and wandered away from. The backer's <em>own</em> list has no state filter at all,
 *       because the pledge they cancelled and the one whose card was refused are exactly
 *       what they opened that screen to find.
 *   <li><strong>Only campaigns a stranger may see.</strong> Applied by the project module,
 *       which owns the states — see below.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Three modules answer one page, and none of them reads another's table</h2>
 *
 * <p>This service holds identifiers and asks:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link PublicProfiles} whether there is a profile at this slug at all. §4.2's P-07
 *       withdraws the page <em>and its archives</em>, so a backed tab that answered 200 for
 *       an account whose page answers 404 would publish through a second URL what the first
 *       withholds. {@code users} is not this module's table and the setting is not this
 *       module's to interpret.
 *   <li>{@link ProfileCampaigns} what those campaigns are. {@code projects} is the project
 *       module's; {@code SavedListResponse} names reading it from outside as the reason its
 *       own response has no cover image and refuses to close the gap that way. It also
 *       applies §6.1's nine public states, which is the fourth rule above and belongs where
 *       the vocabulary is.
 *   <li>{@link RewardTitles} what a tier is called, for the backer's own list only.
 *       {@code reward_tiers} is the reward module's, and {@code BackerListRepository} makes
 *       this exact argument about the creator's report three files away.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Three extra reads per page, each bounded by the page size rather than by anything the
 * caller controls. That is what the module boundary costs and it is the price named in each
 * of those three files.
 *
 * <h2>Why the archive's page can come back short</h2>
 *
 * <p>The cursor advances over {@code pledges} and the cards are filtered over
 * {@code projects}, so a page of twenty pledges yields at most twenty cards and sometimes
 * fewer — a campaign trust and safety has suspended is dropped, and so is one whose creator
 * has left. That is deliberate. Backfilling to a full page would mean reading further into
 * the pledge list on every request, which makes the cost of a page depend on how many
 * campaigns somebody backed that were later withdrawn, and makes the cursor's meaning
 * depend on the filter's outcome. A short page with a cursor is a correct page; the client
 * asks for the next one, exactly as it would have anyway.
