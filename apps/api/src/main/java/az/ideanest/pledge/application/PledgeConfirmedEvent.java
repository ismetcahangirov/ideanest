/**
 * {@code pledge.confirmed}: §6.2's {@code DRAFT --> CONFIRMED}, announced.
 *
 * <p>Recorded by {@link PledgeService#confirm} through §8.3's outbox, inside the
 * transaction that performs the transition, so the event and the state change commit
 * together or neither does. {@code Outbox} carries the whole argument for why that is
 * the only ordering that is not a lie; what is here is the body.
 *
 * <p><strong>This is the pledge module's copy of the contract, and it is deliberately
 * a copy.</strong> {@code analytics} declares the same six fields as the shape it
 * reads, and neither record may import the other — {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} fails
 * the build over it, and it is right to: two modules that share a Java type are one
 * module that cannot be deployed separately. What they share instead is the JSON,
 * which is exactly what they would share across a broker. The field names below are
 * therefore the contract, and renaming one is a breaking change to every consumer
 * even though nothing on this side would fail to compile. {@code PledgeEventTests}
 * pins them.
 *
 * <p><strong>A standalone record rather than a member of a {@code PledgeEvents}
 * holder.</strong> {@code AuthEvents} and {@code ProjectEvents} group the messages a
 * module publishes <em>after</em> its commit through Spring's application events —
 * the mechanism §8.3 says loses a message when the process dies in the window. This
 * is the other kind, and putting it beside them would say the two are the same thing.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why a payload with values in it, when {@code Outbox} argues for
 * identifiers.</strong> Its guidance — "enough to route on, and no more" — assumes a
 * consumer that can read the rest inside its own transaction. Attribution cannot: the
 * amount lives in {@code pledges}, which is this module's table, and a consumer
 * reaching for it would be the boundary violation again. So the two facts nobody else
 * can compute travel with the event, and nothing else does. There is no address, no
 * account, no card, and no reward: a module that needs those asks this one.
 *
 * @param pledgeId which pledge. Also the aggregate identifier the event is recorded
 *     under, so that §8.3's per-aggregate ordering is per pledge
 * @param projectId which campaign
 * @param backerId who pledged
 * @param total what the pledge was worth, as §10.3's {@code {"amount", "currency"}}
 *     object with a string amount. <strong>Never a JSON number</strong> — the type
 *     carries its own serialiser, so there is no call site that can produce one
 * @param referrerCode the code the pledge itself carries, when it has one:
 *     {@code pledges.referrer_code}, which §4.5's checkout accepts. Null for the
 *     pledges that arrived without one, which is most of them
 * @param confirmedAt when the transition happened, from the module's injected
 *     {@code Clock} and truncated to what {@code timestamptz} stores. The same
 *     instant that is written to {@code pledges.confirmed_at}, because it is read
 *     back off the row rather than taken again — an event and a column that disagree
 *     about when something happened are two answers to one question
