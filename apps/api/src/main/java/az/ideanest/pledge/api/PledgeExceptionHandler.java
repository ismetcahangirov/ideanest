/**
 * The checkout's refusals, as RFC 9457 problem details.
 *
 * <p>Scoped to this module's controller rather than applied globally, for the reason
 * {@code RewardExceptionHandler} gives: an advice that catches a broad type across
 * the whole service turns a bug somewhere else into a tidy 4xx and hides it.
 *
 * <p>Every response carries a {@code code} as well as a status (§10.4). The status
 * tells a client how to behave and the code tells it what happened — this file
 * answers six different 409s, and a client that had to tell them apart by prose
 * would be matching on English.
 *
 * <p><strong>The idempotency refusals are deliberately not here.</strong>
 * {@code IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED} and its siblings belong to {@code shared}, which is
 * where the machinery lives, and they are answered by
 * {@code ApiExceptionHandler} — because #56's edits and epic #59's charges will raise
 * exactly the same four and must get exactly the same four bodies.
