/**
 * What happens to a campaign's pledges when the campaign is stopped — #103.
 *
 * <h2>Two things, and the second is the one that is easy to forget</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every pledge that is still a pledge becomes {@link PledgeState#CANCELED_BY_PROJECT},
 * <strong>and every place those pledges hold goes back on sale</strong>. A campaign that
 * was suspended while holding four hundred places on a limited tier is four hundred
 * places nobody can ever buy, on a campaign nobody can ever back — and the count would
 * stay wrong for as long as the row exists, because nothing else releases them.
 *
 * <h2>What is deliberately not cancelled</h2>
 *
 * <p>A pledge whose money has moved or is moving: {@link PledgeState#CHARGE_PENDING},
 * {@link PledgeState#CHARGE_FAILED} and {@link PledgeState#COLLECTED}. Marking a
 * collected pledge {@code CANCELED_BY_PROJECT} would say the money was never taken, and
 * §6.2 gives the honest edge a different name — {@code COLLECTED → REFUNDED}, which is
 * #67's and needs a payment provider behind it.
 *
 * <p><strong>None of those states can exist today</strong>, because nothing collects
 * anything: epic #59 is blocked on choosing a provider, and §9.2 is explicit that no
 * money moves before it. So this counts them and logs a warning naming the campaign
 * rather than acting on them — an empty branch would be the same code with nothing to
 * find when it stops being empty.
 *
 * <h2>Why one transaction</h2>
 *
 * <p>The listener runs inside the dispatch transaction, so a campaign whose pledges
 * could not all be released is a dispatch that failed and an event that is retried. Half
 * a release — some pledges cancelled, some places still held — is the one outcome nobody
 * can repair from the outside, because there is no record of which half ran.
