 * What a backer is buying from the pledge manager's add-on store — §4.8's PM-10.

 * <p><strong>These are new lines, not a new selection.</strong> The body says what to
 * add; it does not restate what the pledge already has, which is what {@code PATCH
 * /v1/pledges/{id}} does while the campaign is running. Sending the whole selection
 * here would make the two endpoints look interchangeable, and they are not: an edit
 * re-quotes a pledge that has not been charged, and this is a separate purchase.
 *
 * <p>Not empty. A purchase of nothing is a request the client should not have made,
 * and answering it with a supplement of zero would be a row a collection run has to
 * decide what to do with.
