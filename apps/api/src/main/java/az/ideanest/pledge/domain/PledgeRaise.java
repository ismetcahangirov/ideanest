/**
 * One attempt to raise a paid pledge while its campaign is taking pledges — #171, V83.
 *
 * <h2>Why a row, and not an edit of the pledge</h2>
 *
 * <p>A {@code COLLECTED} pledge has been paid for, so raising it means taking more money, and the
 * money is taken on the provider's page in a second request that may never come. The pledge must not
 * change before the provider says the difference was paid: a backer who closes the page has raised
 * nothing, and a pledge that already showed the new total would be a promise about money that never
 * arrived. So the new selection is written here, priced, with the places it needs held, and it is
 * copied onto the pledge only when the charge settles.
 *
 * <h2>What it is measured against</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #getBaseVersion()} is the pledge's version when the raise was quoted, and
 * {@link #getAmount()} is the difference between the pledge's total then and the new total. The raise
 * is applied only to that same pledge: anything that has moved it since would make the difference a
 * difference from a pledge that no longer exists, and the charge is returned instead
 * ({@link PledgeRaiseState#UNAPPLIED}).
