/**
 * What a backer does with a pledge: make one, read it, confirm it, change it, and
 * withdraw it.
 *
 * <p>§4.5's flow, minus the two halves that belong elsewhere. Reserving the places,
 * pricing the selection and moving places from one tier to another are
 * {@link ReservationService}, which #51 built and #52, #56 and #203 extended;
 * replaying a retried request is {@code shared.idempotency}, which wraps every
 * mutation here. What is left is the ordering, the campaign's own answer about whether
 * it will take a pledge, and §6.2's transitions.
 *
 * <p><strong>Nothing here writes {@code reward_tiers} any more (#203).</strong>
 * Confirmation used to move its single place itself, which was reasonable while a
 * pledge held one; a pledge holding places on its reward <em>and</em> on each add-on
 * is the same map the other four stock paths move, so the fifth moved next to them.
 * One class writes the stock columns, which is the only way the five paths can be
 * checked against each other by reading them.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@link #requireEditable} is the one place that says whether a backer
 * may still act on a pledge.</strong> §4.5's PL-09 and PL-10 are each bounded by two
 * facts owned by two modules — §6.2's states here, the campaign's deadline in
 * {@code project} — and scattering that pair across the edit and the cancellation
 * would be two rules free to drift apart.
 *
 * <p><strong>Where the campaign check lives, and why here.</strong>
 * {@code ReservationService} deliberately does not ask whether the campaign is
 * taking pledges — its javadoc says so — because that is a question about
 * {@code projects} and answering it there would make the pledge module depend on the
 * project module in order to refuse the same request twice. It is asked here,
 * through {@link PledgeAcceptance}, which is the project module's application layer
 * and the only part of it this module may see. {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} fails the
 * build over the alternative.
 *
 * <p><strong>Nothing here charges anything.</strong> §9.2 is explicit: at
 * confirmation the card is verified and the verification is voided, no money moves,
 * and no ledger entry is written. Today not even the verification happens — see
 * {@link PledgeCapability#CARD_VERIFICATION}, which names the issue that owns it.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@link #confirm} is the one method here that announces anything</strong>
 * (#235). It records {@link PledgeConfirmedEvent} through §8.3's outbox, in the
 * transaction that performs the transition — see that method for why it is there and
 * nowhere else. The draft, the edit and the cancellation announce nothing yet, and
 * each is a separate piece of work with a consumer behind it rather than an event
 * recorded because it would be symmetrical.

     * <p><strong>Two things happen, and they are one transaction.</strong> The held
     * places become claimed ones and the pledge becomes {@code CONFIRMED}. Either
     * alone is a lie: a confirmed pledge against places still counted as merely
     * reserved is one the sweep would give away if it ever saw the row as a draft
     * again, and claimed places against a pledge still in {@code DRAFT} are stock
     * nobody will ever release.
     *
     * <p><strong>Every place the pledge holds, which since #203 is the add-ons as
     * well as the reward.</strong> The move itself is
     * {@link ReservationService#confirm}, where the other four stock paths live; what
     * is left here is the three refusals below and the read of the add-on lines, which
     * are needed by the move and by the response and are read once for both. The move
     * per tier is one statement, not a release followed by a claim —
     * {@code RewardTierRepository#commitPlaces} carries the argument for why the tier
     * must never be momentarily short.
     *
     * <p><strong>What §9.2 says happens here and does not yet.</strong> Phase 1 of
     * card-on-file is a verification authorisation, 3-D Secure, storing the token and
     * the scheme transaction identifier, and voiding the authorisation. It is
     * {@link PledgeCapability#CARD_VERIFICATION} — #55, blocked on #60 — and it is
     * absent rather than stubbed. What §9.2 also says, and what makes the rest of
     * this correct without it, is that <em>no money moves at confirmation and no
     * ledger entry is written</em>: the charge is phase 2, at the close of a
     * successful campaign. So this transition commits a backer to a campaign, and
     * that is all it has ever done.
     *
     * <p>{@code paymentMethodId} is accepted and stored so that the shape a client
     * sends does not change when #55 lands. Nothing resolves it, nothing validates
     * it, and the response says {@code cardVerified: false} rather than letting a
     * client infer otherwise.
     *
     * <p><strong>The third thing that happens, and it is the same transaction
     * (#235).</strong> {@link PledgeConfirmedEvent} is recorded through §8.3's outbox,
     * so the row that says the pledge is confirmed and the row that says so to
     * everybody else are written by one commit. That is the entire reason the outbox
     * exists — {@code Outbox} is {@code MANDATORY} precisely so that this cannot
     * accidentally be recorded next to the transaction rather than inside it — and it
     * is what makes a consumer's answer unable to disagree with the pledge it is
     * about. Until this landed the pledge module announced nothing at all, and
     * {@code analytics}' attribution listener, built and tested against a real
     * outbox, saw no traffic in production.
     *
     * <p><strong>After the transition, and on the path that transitions.</strong>
     * Before it, the event would describe a confirmation that the three refusals below
     * may still prevent. And the two ways a confirmation is replayed both miss this
     * line, which is what makes it record once per pledge rather than once per
     * request: an ordinary retry carries the same {@code Idempotency-Key} and is
     * answered by {@code shared.idempotency} without this method running at all, and a
     * client that lost its key and sent a fresh one arrives at a pledge that is no
     * longer a {@code DRAFT} and is refused above. Neither reaches here. The outbox's
     * own delivery is separately at-least-once, which is the consumer's problem and is
     * the contract {@code OutboxMessage} states.
     *
     * @throws PledgeNotFoundException when the pledge is not this backer's
     * @throws PledgeNotDraftException when it is not in {@code DRAFT} — §10.4's
