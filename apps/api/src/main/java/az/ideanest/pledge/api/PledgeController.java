/**
 * A backer's pledge: making one, reading it, confirming it, changing it, and
 * withdrawing it.
 *
 * <p>Seven of §10.2's eight pledge endpoints, the two purchases of §4.8's PM-09 and
 * PM-10 included (#76). {@code GET /receipt} waits on there being a collection to
 * receipt, which is epic #59's.
 *
 * <p><strong>All six mutations require {@code Idempotency-Key}</strong> (§10.3), and
 * the requirement is enforced before anything else about the request is considered. A
 * missing or malformed key is a refusal rather than a request that quietly runs
 * without protection — see {@link IdempotencyKey}.
 *
 * <p><strong>They answer with recorded bytes, not with an object.</strong> The five
 * that have a body return {@code ResponseEntity<String>} carrying JSON that
 * {@link IdempotentRequests} produced and stored, so that a replay is byte-identical
 * to the response it replays. Serialising the result twice — once now, once from a
 * re-read on the retry — would make the guarantee only as good as the two
 * serialisations agreeing, which they stop doing the first time a field is added.
 * The read has nothing to replay and returns the object; the cancellation has no
 * body at all and goes through
 * {@link IdempotentRequests#executeWithoutContent}, which records the zero bytes a
 * {@code 204} sends.
 *
 * <p><strong>Every mutation is counted against §17.3's limit</strong>, the edit and
 * the cancellation included and in the same bucket. What the limit bounds is the work
 * one account can demand, and an edit is the most expensive request here: it settles
 * nothing, but it re-quotes a whole selection and takes a row lock on a reward tier —
 * the row every other backer of that campaign is contending for.
 *
 * <p><strong>Authorisation is not decided here.</strong> The caller's identifier goes
 * down to {@link PledgeService}, whose reads are scoped to it in the query — so
 * somebody else's pledge is a 404 rather than a 403, for the reason
 * {@code PledgeNotFoundException} gives.
 *
 * <p><strong>No {@code Location} header on the draft.</strong> There is one — the
 * pledge is readable at {@code /v1/pledges/{id}} — but the whole resource is in the
 * body, and a client that has to follow a header to learn what it will be charged is
 * one round trip worse off at the checkout.
