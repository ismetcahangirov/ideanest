/**
 * AD-15's third verb — §12.3, issue #315.
 *
 * <p>#86 built preview and test send and said what was missing in as many words: "editing
 * means storing a template, versioning it, and deciding who may change what a
 * payment-failure notice says; that is a screen and a schema". V52 is the schema, this is
 * the rule, and {@code EmailTemplateController} is the screen.
 *
 * <h2>The decision #315 was blocked on</h2>
 *
 * <p>"No decision on who may rewrite a payment-failure notice." It has two halves and only
 * one of them is a role question.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Who.</strong> {@link StaffCapability#CONFIGURE_PLATFORM}, which only
 *       {@code ADMINISTRATOR} holds. Narrower than any other editorial permission on the
 *       platform, because this changes what the running service writes to everybody.
 *   <li><strong>What may not be removed.</strong> A payment-failure notice that no longer
 *       says which card was declined, or no longer carries the link to fix it, is worse
 *       than no override at all — and <em>no role check catches that</em>, because the
 *       administrator editing it is exactly the person who is allowed to. So the shipped
 *       copy's placeholders are extracted and the override must keep every one of them.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>That is a narrow answer to a narrow question. It does not settle the larger one —
 * whether a transactional notice should be editable at all — and #315's follow-up can
 * argue that now there is a screen to argue about.
 *
 * <h2>Every edit is a new version</h2>
 *
 * <p>Nothing is updated in place. "What did the notice say in March" is asked when somebody
 * claims they were never told their card had failed, and {@code email_deliveries} records
 * what was sent while this records what it was sent from.
