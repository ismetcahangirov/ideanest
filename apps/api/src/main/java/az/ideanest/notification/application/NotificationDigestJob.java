/**
 * §8.4's {@code notification-digest}: the job §12.2 promised and #244 reported missing.
 *
 * <p>{@code NotificationSender} is this class for the immediate queue, and the shape is
 * deliberately the same: a bounded pass that asks {@link DigestAssembly} for one message at a
 * time until there is nothing due or the pass is spent. Its reasoning about that shape applies
 * here without change — the transaction is inside the loop and not around it, because a pass that
 * opened one transaction and sent a hundred messages would re-send all hundred on a rollback
 * after the ninety-ninth; a refusal does not end the pass, because every digest still waiting is
 * somebody else's; and nothing here retries, because a retry is the next pass finding the group
 * eligible again.
 *
 * <h2>Hourly, for a daily digest</h2>
 *
 * <p>Not a contradiction, and {@code DigestWindow} is where the argument lives. The alternative —
 * a cron that fires once a day at the digest hour — is the one in which a single missed tick
 * delays a whole day's digest by a whole day, silently. So what the pass does is send everything
 * held from before the most recently <em>closed</em> digest period, which makes the cron's
 * frequency a statement about promptness rather than about correctness: an hourly tick means a
 * due digest goes out within the hour, and a tick lost to a deployment costs an hour rather than
 * a day.
 *
 * <p>Twenty-three ticks out of twenty-four therefore find nothing and return, which costs one
 * indexed query against a partial index. That is the price of the property above.
 *
 * <p><strong>On the shared scheduler, and this one genuinely needs the lease.</strong>
 * {@code AnalyticsRollupJob} makes the same declaration for the same reason and
 * {@link DigestAssembly} explains what specifically depends on it: a digest's claim is two
 * statements rather than one, because rows behind a {@code GROUP BY} cannot be locked, and the
 * lease is what stops two replicas picking the same group in the window between them. Moving
 * this to a per-replica timer would reintroduce a race whose symptom is somebody receiving the
 * same digest twice.
 *
 * <p>Throwing is how a failed pass is recorded. {@code JobRunner} counts the attempt in
 * {@code scheduled_jobs}, releases the lease, and backs off; catching a failure here to keep the
 * log tidy would have the job recorded as having succeeded.
