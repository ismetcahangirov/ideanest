/**
 * The other half of the notification queue: something that drains it.
 *
 * <p>{@code NotificationFanOut} writes rows in the dispatch transaction and deliberately
 * sends nothing, because a sent email cannot be rolled back. That makes the rows a
 * promise, and a promise is worth nothing until a process keeps it. This is that process
 * — a poll that asks {@link NotificationDispatch} for one notification at a time until
 * the queue is empty or the pass is spent.
 *
 * <p>{@code OutboxRelay} is the same class one hop earlier and its reasoning is not
 * repeated here: a poll rather than {@code LISTEN}/{@code NOTIFY} because the poll has to
 * exist anyway to be the guarantee; safe on more than one replica because
 * {@code claimNext} is {@code FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED}, so two senders divide the queue
 * rather than meeting on a row; a {@link ScheduledJob} rather than {@code @Scheduled} so
 * that the tick takes a lease and is counted when it throws.
 *
 * <h2>What this class must not do, and why the pass is shaped the way it is</h2>
 *
 * <p><strong>One notification per transaction, and the transaction is inside the loop,
 * not around it.</strong> {@link NotificationDispatch#sendNext} is {@code @Transactional}
 * and is called through the proxy from here, which is the only reason that boundary
 * exists at all. A pass that opened one transaction and sent a hundred messages would
 * re-send all hundred on a rollback after the ninety-ninth.
 *
 * <p><strong>A refusal does not end the pass.</strong> Every notification still waiting
 * is somebody else's, and stopping on the first one a channel refused would let one bad
 * address hold up the queue — {@code OutboxRelay} and {@code ReservationCleanerJob} both
 * carry on for the same reason. The refused row has already been counted and given a next
 * attempt by the time this sees the outcome.
 *
 * <p><strong>The pass is bounded by {@code batchSize}.</strong> A backlog built up while
 * a transport was down must not become one pass that overlaps its own next tick. The
 * remainder is one tick away.
 *
 * <p><strong>Nothing here retries.</strong> A retry is the next pass finding the row
 * eligible again, which is the whole point of {@code next_attempt_at}: a loop that
 * retried in place would hold a lease while it slept and would lose the backoff on a
 * restart.
