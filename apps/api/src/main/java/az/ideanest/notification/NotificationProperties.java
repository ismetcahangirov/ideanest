     * @param zone whose clock {@link #atHour} is read on. {@code RollupWindow} makes the
     *     argument for a zone rather than UTC and every word of it applies: Baku is UTC+4, so
     *     a fixed UTC hour is a different local hour, and the entire point of choosing an hour

     *     {@code ZoneId} rather than an offset, so that a zone which observes daylight saving
     *     keeps the local hour rather than drifting an hour twice a year
     * @param atHour the local hour a digest goes out at. Eight in the morning: late enough
     *     that a phone is not waking somebody, early enough that a campaign closing today is
     *     still something they can act on. A product decision, stated here and in
     *     {@code DigestWindow} rather than left in a cron expression nobody reads
     * @param batchSize how many (recipient, channel) groups one pass may combine. A bound on
     *     the pass, not a target — the same argument {@link Delivery#batchSize} makes: a
     *     backlog built up while the job was failing must not become one pass that overlaps
     *     its own next tick and holds a lease past its lease time
     * @param maxNotificationsPerMessage how many notifications may go into one digest.
     *     <strong>The remainder is not dropped and is not silently deferred</strong>: it stays
     *     {@code HELD}, remains due — its period has already closed — and the next pass sends
     *     it as a further message, which {@code DigestAssembly} logs. Two hundred is well past
     *     any digest a person reads and well short of a message a transport would refuse for
