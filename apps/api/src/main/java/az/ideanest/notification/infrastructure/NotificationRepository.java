     * by an update cannot be made correct — two senders read the same row, both conclude

     * {@code SKIP LOCKED} rather than a wait, so several replicas divide the queue
     * between them instead of meeting on a row.
     *
     * <p><strong>No ordering clause, unlike the outbox.</strong> The relay refuses to
     * publish an event while an earlier pending one for the same aggregate exists,

     * <p><strong>{@code HELD} is not a candidate, and that is still right now that something

     * claims by, and the two queues never contend for a row because a row is in exactly one
