/**
 * §4.10's table, as code: the twenty-two things the platform tells somebody, which
 * category each belongs to, and which channels each has.
 *
 * <p><strong>The crosses in §4.10 are not "off by default".</strong> "Pledge edited"
 * has no push and "24 hours remaining" has no email, and those are channels the type
 * does not have at all — no preference turns them on, and the fan-out never considers
 * them. That distinction is the reason the supported set lives here, on the type,
 * rather than being expressed as a default preference somewhere: a default is
 * something a person may overrule, and this is not.
 *
 * <p><strong>Most of these have no producer.</strong> The platform records almost no
 * outbox events yet — {@code PledgeConfirmed} in the analytics module says so at
 * length about the one it consumes — so the catalogue is deliberately complete while
 * {@code NotificationEventListener} translates only the handful of event types that
 * have a defined shape. A type in this enum with nothing that produces it is a row of
 * §4.10 waiting for its producer, not an oversight; a type missing from it would be a
 * notification the preference page cannot describe.
