/**
 * What an email says, decided per notification type.
 *
 * <p>The half of #86 that is about words rather than about SMTP. It reads
 * {@code notifications.params}, pulls out the facts the type's copy refers to, and asks
 * {@code messages.properties} for the sentences — so changing what an email says is
 * editing a properties file, and changing which facts it may mention is editing the
 * switch below.
 *
 * <h2>The switch is exhaustive, deliberately</h2>
 *
 * <p>There is no {@code default}. Adding a constant to {@link NotificationType} therefore
 * fails to compile until somebody has decided what the email for it says, which is the
 * one property worth having here: the alternative is a template that resolves to an empty
 * string and an email that goes out saying nothing, discovered by whoever receives it.
 *
 * <p><strong>Thirteen of the twenty types have no producer yet</strong> — nothing
 * publishes an event that becomes a {@code SURVEY_AVAILABLE} or a {@code REWARD_SHIPPED},
 * and #64, #74 and #87 are where those arrive. Their copy is written all the same, for
 * the same reason the enum lists them: the row exists in §4.10, the preference model
 * already resolves it, and a type whose email is written the day its event lands is a
 * type whose email is written in a hurry.
 *
 * <h2>Naming the campaign — #249, and why there are two keys</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code params} now carries {@code projectTitle} on every notification about a
 * campaign, so the copy can say which one. It cannot simply say it, because the rows
 * written before #249 have no title in them and neither will a row whose campaign was
 * deleted between the event and the send — and a sentence built around {@code {1}} renders
 * with a hole in it when {@code {1}} is empty.
 *
 * <p>So a key may have a {@code .named} variant, and {@link #copy} prefers it when there is
 * a title to put in it. Two plain sentences rather than one sentence with a conditional
 * inside it: {@code MessageFormat}'s {@code choice} would express the same thing in a form
 * no translator can read, and a single sentence with a generic fallback substituted for the
 * title reads wrongly in at least one of the two cases whatever wording is chosen — "your
 * pledge to this campaign is confirmed" is not English anybody writes.
 *
 * <p>A type with no {@code .named} variant is a type whose copy reads the same either way.
 * That is the common case for the button and for the paragraphs that are about money rather
 * than about which campaign it was.
