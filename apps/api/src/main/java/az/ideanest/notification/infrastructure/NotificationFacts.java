/**
 * What a notification is about, read once for every channel that has to say it.
 *
 * <h2>Why this was extracted, and what it prevents</h2>
 *
 * <p>It was {@code EmailComposer}'s private half until #87 gave push a transport. Both
 * channels answer the same two questions — <em>which facts may this type's copy mention</em>
 * and <em>where does tapping it go</em> — and the answers are properties of the
 * notification rather than of email or of push.
 *
 * <p>Left where it was, the switch below would have been copied into a push composer, and
 * the copy would have been correct on the day it was made. The failure it prevents is not
 * hypothetical: {@code PAYMENT_FAILED} reads {@code attempt} into slot {@code 3}, and a
 * second extraction that read it into {@code 2} would produce a push notification saying
 * "we tried to collect 3 and the payment was declined" — from copy that is right, using
 * facts that are wrong, in a message about somebody's money.
 *
 * <p><strong>The paths are relative</strong>, and that is the one thing that genuinely
 * differs between the two channels: email resolves them against
 * {@code ideanest.notification.email.base-url} so a preview environment's mail does not
 * send readers to production, and push resolves them against the {@code ideanest://}
 * scheme so a tap opens the application rather than a browser. Returning a path rather
 * than a URL is what lets one method serve both.

     * Where tapping the message goes, as a path.

     * <p>Five sources, in this order, and the order is the point:
     *
     * <ol>
     *   <li>The type, when the message is not about a campaign at all. Only
     *       {@code NEW_DEVICE_SIGN_IN} is: it is about the account, and what a person who
     *       did not recognise that sign-in needs is the session list.
     *   <li>The campaign's public path, {@code /projects/{creatorSlug}/{projectSlug}}, from
     *       the two slugs #249 puts in {@code params}. <strong>This is the only one of
     *       these that addresses the campaign page.</strong>
     *   <li>{@code params.projectId}, which the pledge-shaped types carry.
     *   <li>The subject, when it is a campaign.
     *   <li>The root. A message with nowhere specific to go still gives the reader
     *       somewhere to go, and a button pointing at nothing is worse than the home page.
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p><strong>The third and fourth are kept, and they are wrong.</strong> §10.2's
     * campaign page takes two slugs, so {@code /projects/{uuid}} matches no route and
     * answers 404 — which is what every email the platform had sent did, and what the rows
     * written before #249 will keep doing, because their documents hold no slugs and
     * nothing here can invent them. Removing them would send those readers to the home page
     * instead; that is arguably better and it is a change to what old messages do, so it is
     * left to whoever decides that rather than taken quietly here. Every row written from
     * now on takes the second branch.
     *
     * <p><strong>It matters more on push than it ever did on email.</strong> A browser
     * shown a 404 renders a page saying so. {@code apps/mobile}'s {@code lib/links.ts}
     * refuses a path it does not recognise outright, so a push notification built on the
     * third branch opens the application and goes nowhere at all — see
     * {@link PushComposer}, which is why it sends only the second.
