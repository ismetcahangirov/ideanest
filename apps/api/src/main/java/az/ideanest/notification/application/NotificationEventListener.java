/**
 * How the notification module hears that something happened.
 *
 * <p>A listener on {@code OutboxMessage}, switching on {@link OutboxMessage#eventType()},
 * because that is the shape {@code ApplicationEventOutboxDispatcher} prescribes in its
 * own class comment: the dispatcher stays untyped so that no per-event Java class
 * becomes a compile-time coupling between the relay and every module's events, and so
 * that nothing has to be rebuilt the day these messages arrive from another service
 * instead of from a table.
 *
 * <p><strong>This is the whole of the coupling between notifications and the modules
 * that produce these events, and it is a string.</strong> {@code ModuleBoundaryTests}
 * forbids reaching into another module's domain or infrastructure; a listener on a
 * published event reaches into neither. Nothing in this file imports anything from
 * {@code az.ideanest.pledge} or {@code az.ideanest.project}, which is checkable, is
 * checked, and is asserted directly by {@code NotificationBoundaryTests}.
 *
 * <p>{@link NotificationEvents} says which of §4.10's rows have a producer and which are still
 * waiting for one, event by event.
 *
 * <h2>Translation, and what this module is allowed to know</h2>
 *
 * <p>Each branch below turns one payload into {@link NotificationRequest}s: who to tell,
 * which of §4.10's rows it is, and what a template will need. It does not decide which
 * channels — that is §4.10's table, on {@link NotificationType} — and it does not decide
 * whether to send, which is the recipient's preference and {@code NotificationFanOut}'s
 * job.
 *
 * <p><strong>A recipient comes out of the payload, or out of a published port. Never out of
 * another module's tables.</strong> A translation may not look up who ought to be told by
 * reading {@code pledges} or {@code project_reminders}; that is the coupling this whole
 * arrangement exists to prevent, and nothing in this file imports anything from
 * {@code az.ideanest.pledge} or {@code az.ideanest.project}.
 *
 * <p>#85 stopped there, which meant {@link GoalReached} notified the creator and nobody else —
 * the least useful half of that event, since the people who funded the campaign heard nothing.
 * #245 is the port that fixes it: {@code shared.audience.ProjectAudiences} is a question the
 * module owning the rows answers, so the audience is <em>asked for</em> rather than read.
 * {@link #audienceOf} is the one call site, and it is where the bound on a computed audience is
 * applied and logged.
 *
 * <p><strong>#245 is finished here, and #90 is what finished it.</strong> The port shipped with
 * one audience — {@code BACKERS}, from {@code pledges} — because {@code saves} and
 * {@code follows} did not exist, so §4.10's "followed creator launched" and "saved project
 * ending soon" had copy, channels and a preference category and no audience at all. Both are
 * translated below now, from {@code FOLLOWERS} and {@code SAVERS}, which the community module
 * answers.
 *
 * <p>#249 is the second port and the same shape again. A translation may not read
 * {@code projects} to find out what a campaign is called, so {@code shared.project.ProjectSummaries}
 * publishes the question; {@link #about} is the one call site, and what it puts in the
 * document is the title <em>as it was when the event happened</em> rather than as it is when
 * somebody opens the message.
 *
 * <p><strong>Set arithmetic across two audiences happens here and nowhere else.</strong>
 * {@link #endingSoon} sends "saved project ending soon" to the savers who are not backers, and
 * that subtraction is a decision about what the messages mean rather than a query optimisation
 * — see the method. It is the one place two audiences of one event meet, and
 * {@link #concat} states why deduplicating them is load-bearing.
 *
 * <h2>Failure</h2>
 *
 * <p>Three kinds, and they are answered differently on purpose.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>An event this module does not recognise.</strong> Ignored, silently, and
 *       that is the only correct answer: the dispatcher publishes every event to every
 *       listener, so a comment being posted reaches this method too, and treating an
 *       unrecognised type as a fault would make every module's events every other
 *       module's problem.
 *   <li><strong>The notifications failed to write.</strong> It throws, the dispatch
 *       transaction rolls back with it, the event stays {@code PENDING}, and the relay
 *       tries again. That is what an at-least-once transport is for and it is the reason
 *       {@code NotificationFanOut} is {@code MANDATORY}.
 *   <li><strong>The payload cannot be read, or is missing something this module needs.</strong>
 *       It throws too, and that is a deliberate choice rather than an oversight. An
 *       event whose body this module does not understand will not be understood on the
 *       next attempt either, so the retries are wasted and the eighth one dead-letters
 *       it — which is exactly right: a producer and a consumer that disagree about a
 *       payload is a fault somebody has to see, and swallowing it would mean people
 *       silently not being told things, with nothing anywhere saying so. A notification
 *       nobody receives and nobody misses is the worst failure this module has.
 * </ul>
