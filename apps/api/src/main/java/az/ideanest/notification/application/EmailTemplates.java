/**
 * AD-15's preview and test send, for the email half of §4.10.
 *
 * <p>AD-15 is "email templates: edit, preview, test send". <strong>Two of the three, and
 * the missing one is named rather than half-built.</strong> Editing means storing a
 * template, versioning it, and deciding who may change what a payment-failure notice
 * says; that is a screen and a schema and it belongs to the administration epic (#100).
 * What #86 owes is the ability to look at what the platform will actually send before it
 * sends it, and to receive one.
 *
 * <h2>Previews render the real path</h2>
 *
 * <p>The preview goes through {@code EmailComposer} and {@code EmailRenderer} — the same
 * two objects the sender uses — against a sample document. A preview built any other way
 * would be a picture of a template rather than of a message, and the first thing it would
 * stop catching is exactly the class of fault it exists to catch: a key that does not
 * resolve, a placeholder with no argument, a layout that breaks when a body has two
 * paragraphs.
 *
 * <h2>A test send goes to the caller, and only to the caller</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #testSend} takes no address. It reads the one on the staff account making the
 * request and sends there.
 *
 * <p>That is a deliberate refusal rather than a simplification. An authenticated endpoint
 * that takes an arbitrary recipient and a template is a machine for sending
 * platform-branded mail to anybody — the credential for which is one compromised staff
 * account — and the message it sends looks exactly like a real payment notice, because it
 * is one. Whatever "send a test to the address on the invoice" is worth, it is not worth
 * building that and hoping.
 *
 * <p>Nothing is written to {@code email_deliveries} for a test send, and it cannot be:
 * that table's rows point at a notification or a digest, and a test send is neither. It
 * is logged instead, with who asked and which template.

    /**
     * The document a preview is rendered against.
     *
     * <p>One object carrying every field any type reads, rather than one per type:
     * {@code EmailComposer} takes only the keys its type asks for, so a superset is
     * exactly as accurate for each of them and there is one thing to keep in step with
     * the translations instead of twenty.
     *
     * <p>The identifier is fixed rather than random so that two previews of the same
     * template are the same bytes — which is what makes a diff between them meaningful
     * when somebody is reviewing a change to the copy.
     *
     * <p><strong>It carries a campaign name and both slugs</strong>, because since #249 the
     * platform's messages do. A sample without them would preview the fallback copy — the
     * wording reserved for rows written before that change — so a reviewer would be checking
     * the sentences the platform has stopped sending.
