/**
 * Where a phone says it exists, and where it says it has gone — issue #87.
 *
 * <h2>Two endpoints, and why the second one is not a {@code DELETE} by id</h2>
 *
 * <p>Sign-out is the moment a registration must be forgotten, and at that moment the
 * client holds the token and no longer holds a usable session for very long. Addressing
 * the row by token means the call can be made with the credentials that are about to be
 * discarded, and it means a client that has lost track of the identifier can still clean
 * up after itself.
 *
 * <p>The token is in the body of a {@code DELETE} rather than in the path, because a path
 * segment is the one part of a request that ends up in every access log on the way — and
 * a push token is an address somebody can send to.
 *
 * <h2>Both are idempotent, and neither takes an {@code Idempotency-Key}</h2>
 *
 * <p>§10.3's header exists for writes that would otherwise happen twice. Registering the
 * same token twice is the same upsert, and forgetting a token that is already forgotten
 * answers 204 — so there is nothing for a key to collapse. Registration is called on
 * every cold start, which is what keeps {@code last_seen_at} meaningful, so a header
 * would be paid on every launch for nothing.
 *
 * <h2>Rate limiting</h2>
 *
 * <p>Per account rather than per address, following {@code NotificationPreferenceController}:
 * the request carries a token, so limiting by address would punish everybody behind one
 * NAT and constrain nobody holding a credential. The budget is generous — a phone that
 * loses its permission and regains it can legitimately register several times in a row —
 * and what matters is that a client stuck in a loop cannot write unboundedly.
