/**
 * Expo's push service, as the two calls this platform makes to it — issue #87.
 *
 * <h2>Why Expo and not APNs and FCM directly</h2>
 *
 * <p>§14.3 names it, and the reason it is the right call for this platform rather than
 * merely the easy one is that the alternative is two credentials with two rotation
 * stories, two payload shapes, and a token-per-platform question in every send path — in
 * exchange for removing a hop from a message that is already best-effort. `apps/mobile`
 * is an Expo application; its tokens are Expo tokens; going around the service would mean
 * ejecting from the toolchain to save a dependency that is on the delivery path of
 * nothing critical.
 *
 * <h2>The whole of the error handling is the RECEIPT, not the response code</h2>
 *
 * <p>This is the part that is easy to get wrong and expensive to get wrong quietly.
 * Expo's send endpoint answers 200 for a batch in which individual messages failed, and
 * the per-message {@code status} inside the response is where {@code DeviceNotRegistered}
 * appears. A client that checked only the HTTP status would keep sending to phones that
 * uninstalled the application months ago, for ever, and would never know.
 *
 * <p>So {@link Ticket} carries the per-message outcome, and {@code PushChannelSender} acts
 * on it — dropping the registration when the service says the device is gone.
 *
 * <h2>Timeouts are set, because the default is none</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code CacheInvalidator} makes the same point: a request with no read timeout against
 * a service that has accepted the connection and stopped answering holds the calling
 * thread for ever, and the calling thread here belongs to the notification sender.
