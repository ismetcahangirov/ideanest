/**
 * What a preference is expressed about.

 * <p>§4.10 lists twenty-two kinds of notification and then says, in one line, that
 * "preferences are per category and per channel". This is that grouping, and it is a
 * usability decision rather than a storage one: twenty-two switches times three
 * channels is a settings page nobody finishes reading, and the rows that belong
 * together — "payment collected", "payment failed", "final payment warning" — are
 * exactly the ones somebody wants to answer once.
 *
 * <p>The cost is stated rather than hidden: a backer who wants the confirmation but
 * not the survey reminder cannot express that, because both are the campaign they
 * backed. Splitting a category later is possible and is a migration plus a decision
 * about what everybody's existing instruction means for the two halves — which is why
 * {@code notifications.category} is stored on the row rather than derived at read
 * time.
