/**
 * {@code PATCH /v1/me/notification-preferences}.
 *
 * <p><strong>A list of switches rather than a whole page, which is the point of the
 * {@code PATCH}.</strong> {@code PreferenceChange} argues it: a settings page sends what
 * somebody touched, and a {@code PUT} would mean any request that omitted a switch silently
 * reset it — which on a page open in two tabs is one tab quietly undoing the other.
 *
 * <p><strong>These three fields carry bean-validation annotations, unlike most bodies in
 * this service.</strong> {@code PostCommentRequest} deliberately has none, because the rule
 * about what a comment may say lives in a value object the entity calls on the way in.
 * There is no equivalent here: the three fields are enums, so the only thing that can be
 * wrong with a well-formed request is that one of them is absent, and the alternative to
 * annotating it is {@code PreferenceChange}'s constructor raising a
 * {@code NullPointerException} — a 500 for what is plainly the caller's mistake. An
 * unrecognised enum value never reaches here at all: Jackson refuses the body and §10.4's
 * handler answers 400.
 *
 * <p>There is no account in the body. Whose preferences these are is the access token, and
 * a {@code userId} field would be the one field that decides it.
 *
 * @param preferences the switches to set. Empty is accepted and changes nothing, which
 *     makes this endpoint a read as well — {@code NotificationPreferences.apply} answers
 *     with the whole page either way, so a client with nothing to change does not need a
 *     second route
