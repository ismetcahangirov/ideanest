/**
 * The domain events this module listens for, as <em>this</em> module reads them.
 *
 * <h2>Read this before adding one</h2>
 *
 * <p><strong>Nothing publishes any of these yet.</strong> At the time #85 was built the
 * platform recorded no outbox event at all — {@code analytics.application.PledgeConfirmed}
 * says the same thing about the one event it consumes, at length — so the listener sees
 * no traffic and {@code notifications} stays empty until a producer exists. That is
 * stated here rather than implied, because a feature that looks finished and produces
 * nothing is worse than one that says what it is waiting for.
 *
 * <p>The remaining work per event is one call inside the transaction that already makes
 * the change: {@code outbox.record("pledge", pledgeId, "pledge.confirmed", …)} with the
 * fields below. It is not in this change because #85 owns the notification module and
 * {@code pledge} and {@code project} are somebody else's files to edit — doing it from
 * here would be the coupling {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} exists to prevent, arrived at
 * by convenience. #235 is adding the {@code pledge.confirmed} producer in parallel; this
 * listener keys on the string, so it starts working the moment that lands, with no
 * change here.
 *
 * <h2>These are copies, and they are supposed to be</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code analytics.application.PledgeConfirmed} declares a record of the same name
 * for the same event, and the duplication is the design rather than a missed
 * refactoring. A shared event class would be a compile-time coupling between every
 * consumer and every producer — the thing {@code ApplicationEventOutboxDispatcher}
 * refuses to introduce when it keeps the dispatch untyped — and it would mean a
 * consumer that needs one more field forcing a rebuild on consumers that do not. What
 * is shared is the event-type string and the wire shape; each module owns its reading
 * of it.
 *
 * <h2>Unknown properties are ignored, deliberately</h2>
 *
 * <p>The opposite of {@code MoneyDeserializer}, which refuses them, and for the opposite
 * reason. There the sender is a client whose bug should be reported while it can still
 * be fixed; here the sender is another module in a rolling deployment, and an event
 * enriched by the newer release must not be undeliverable to the older one. §8.3's
 * expand-then-contract rule applied to a message instead of a column.
 *
 * <h2>A missing field is a fault, and it is loud</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every recipient identifier below is required. A payload without one is a payload
 * this module cannot act on, and {@code NotificationEventListener} throws rather than
 * skipping — see its failure section for why swallowing it would be worse.
