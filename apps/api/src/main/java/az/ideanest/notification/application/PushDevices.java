/**
 * Which phones to send to — issue #87's registry.
 *
 * <h2>Registration is an upsert on the token, and the account is what it rewrites</h2>
 *
 * <p>Two people can sign into one phone. Were both registrations kept, the second
 * person's pledge confirmation would arrive on a device the first person is holding, and
 * a notification is not a small disclosure — §4.10's push copy names amounts and campaign
 * titles. So a token belongs to whoever signed in most recently and to nobody else, which
 * the unique index on {@code token} is what makes expressible.
 *
 * <p>The reverse — one person, several phones — is a real case and is supported: the
 * tokens differ, so the rows differ, and a send goes to all of them.
 *
 * <h2>The token is validated here as well as in the schema</h2>
 *
 * <p>Expo refuses a whole batch containing one malformed token. A single bad row would
 * therefore stop everybody else in that batch being told anything, so the shape is
 * checked at the two points a bad one can enter: {@code push_devices_token_shape} and
 * {@link #REGISTERED_TOKEN}. That is not belt and braces — one of them is a client
 * mistake caught with a 400, and the other is anything that reaches the table another way.
