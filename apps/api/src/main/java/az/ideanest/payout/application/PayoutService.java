/**
 * What a creator is owed, and the two signatures before it leaves — §9, §4.11's AD-05,
 * issues #69 and #306.
 *
 * <h2>Four steps, and each one is somebody's decision</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #calculate} freezes the figure. The campaign has closed, the collections
 *       are summed, the fees are priced against the schedule in force, and the hold
 *       begins.
 *   <li>{@link #queue} shows it, and moves it to {@code PENDING_APPROVAL} when the hold
 *       runs out.
 *   <li>{@link #approve} takes a signature. Above the configured threshold it takes two,
 *       from two different accounts.
 *   <li>{@link #send} instructs the provider.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>The figures are frozen and never recomputed</h2>
 *
 * <p>V55's header has the argument. A payout is derivable from collections, refunds and a
 * fee schedule, and all three move — so recomputing on read produces a different number
 * from the one two people approved, and the approval becomes an approval of nothing in
 * particular. A change afterwards produces a <em>new</em> payout.
 *
 * <p>The corollary is that a refund issued between calculation and sending is not
 * reflected, which would be a real hole if the hold did not exist. {@link #send} therefore
 * re-reads the campaign's funds and refuses if the net has moved — the payout is cancelled
 * and recalculated rather than sent at a figure that is no longer true.
 *
 * <h2>Dual approval is two rows, and they cannot be the same person</h2>
 *
 * <p>V55 makes {@code (payout_id, approver_id)} the primary key, so "two different people"
 * is a constraint rather than a check somebody has to remember. {@code APPROVE_PAYOUT} is
 * held by {@code ADMINISTRATOR} alone and deliberately not by {@code FINANCE} — a role
 * conferring both issuing and approving would make the second signature a formality
 * whenever the finance team is one person.

     * money sent to a stranger — after two people had approved a payout to somebody whose bank
