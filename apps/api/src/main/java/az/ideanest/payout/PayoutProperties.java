/**
 * §9's hold and §4.11's dual approval, as numbers an operator can change — issue #69.
 *
 * @param hold how long after a campaign closes before its money may leave.
 *     <strong>Fourteen days by default</strong>, which is not arbitrary: a chargeback can
 *     be raised weeks after a charge, and a payout sent before the refunds and disputes
 *     have landed is money the platform has to chase a creator for. Longer is safer for
 *     the platform and worse for the creator, who is waiting to build the thing people
 *     paid for — this is the shortest window that covers the ordinary refund request
 * @param dualApprovalThreshold the amount above which a payout needs two signatures.
 *     Compared against the <em>net</em>, which is what actually leaves. Zero would mean
 *     every payout needs two people, which on a platform with one finance member of staff
 *     means none can ever be sent
 * @param approvalsAboveThreshold how many distinct approvers a payout above the threshold
 *     needs. Two by default. Configurable rather than hard-coded because the number is a
 *     policy and not a fact, and because a deployment that has grown may want three on the
 *     largest ones
 * @param currency what {@link #dualApprovalThreshold} is denominated in, and the currency
 *     a campaign with no settled charge reports zero in. §21.2 gives nothing to convert
 *     with, so a payout in another currency is compared against a threshold that does not
 *     apply — {@code PayoutService} takes the safe branch and requires the higher count
