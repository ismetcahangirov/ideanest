/**
 * What a creator is owed, frozen at the moment it was worked out — V55, issues #69 and
 * #306.
 *
 * <p><strong>Every figure is stored and none is derived.</strong> V55's header has the
 * argument: a payout is derivable from the collections, the refunds and the fee schedule,
 * and every one of those moves. Recomputing on read would produce a different number from
 * the one two people approved, and the approval would then be an approval of nothing in
 * particular.
 *
 * <p>The fee schedule that produced the deductions is named on the row, so the arithmetic
 * can be re-derived years later without depending on what is in force then.
