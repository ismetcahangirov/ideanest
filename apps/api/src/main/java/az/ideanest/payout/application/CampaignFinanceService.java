/**
 * §4.7's CD-16 — the creator's financial summary. Issue #99.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is in the payout module</h2>
 *
 * Because everything it reports is already decided here. {@code PayoutService} prices a
 * campaign against §5.2's schedule, takes the fees off the gross and the refunds off what is
 * left, and stores all six figures on the row; this answers the same question one step earlier
 * and, once a payout exists, answers it by reading that row rather than by computing it again.
 * A second implementation of the same arithmetic in a dashboard module is a second answer to
 * "what am I owed", and the two would disagree the first time §5.2's rates changed.
 *
 * <h2>Projected and settled are different statements</h2>
 *
 * Before a payout is calculated there is no fee that has been charged — there is a schedule and
 * what it would price today. That is worth showing, and it is not the same as "this is what you
 * were paid". {@link CampaignFinance.Basis} says which one the caller is looking at, and the
 * fee schedule's identifier is on the record either way, so a campaign quoted before a rate
 * change and paid after one has an explicable difference rather than a discrepancy.
 *
 * <h2>WHAT `reconciled` MEANS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT</h2>
 *
 * It means the campaign's ledger entries balance: summed per currency across every account,
 * the debits equal the credits. V41's deferred constraint trigger already refuses a posting
 * that does not, so it can only be false if a row arrived past both the application and the
 * trigger — which is precisely the day somebody needs to see it rather than be reassured.
 *
 * <p>It does <strong>not</strong> mean the figures above it were derived from the ledger. They
 * are not, and cannot be yet:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>The fee split is never posted.</strong> A collection debits escrow and credits
 *       the creator; a payout does the reverse for the <em>net</em>. Nothing writes
 *       {@code platform_fee}, so the difference stays in escrow as a balance no account claims,
 *       and the creator's account keeps a residual credit equal to the fees for ever.
 *       {@code CollectionRun} and {@code PayoutPostings} each say the other one posts the
 *       split; neither does. That is #69's to close and it is named here rather than papered
 *       over, because a summary claiming to be reconciled to books that do not carry the fee
 *       would be claiming more than it can.
 *   <li><strong>{@code tax_payable} has no writer either</strong>, for a different and better
 *       reason: §4.10's tax collection is #78 and is blocked on a legal answer, so there is no
 *       tax to post.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Both balances are published on the response as they actually are, which is what lets a
 * creator — or whoever they show it to — see the gap rather than take a total on trust.
