     * The two below are the admin user list -- §4.11's AD-04 (#104), folded and indexed by
     * #413.
     *
     * TWO QUERIES BECAUSE ONE OF THEM SEARCHES. They used to be one, with `:term IS NULL`
     * standing for "everything"; that is one statement whose plan has to serve two reads that
     * have nothing in common, and on the searching half it quietly costs the indexes this
     * issue is about. PostgreSQL folds `$1 IS NULL` away while it is planning with the actual
     * value, and stops folding it the moment the statement is hot enough to earn a generic
     * plan -- at which point the disjunction becomes a filter and the read falls back to the
     * sequential scan it was just taken off. A filter that disappears under load is worse than
     * one that was never claimed. Spelled as two, each is exactly the plan it says it is.
     *
     * It is also the call `PaymentTransactionRepository` makes about its own status filter,
     * for the same reason and in the same words.
     *
     * MATCHED ON `ideanest_fold` AND NOT ON `lower`. §11.3's fold is the platform's one
     * comparison form -- `Slugs.fold` in Java, `ideanest_fold(text)` in the database (V13) --
     * and every other search on the platform uses it. This one did not, because JPQL may only
     * name a function the dialect knows and nothing had registered it; `SearchFoldFunctionContributor`
     * is that registration, and it is what makes the two halves of #413 one change.
     *
     * What it fixes is two things at once. `lower()` leaves ə, ı, ö, ü, ğ, ş and ç alone, so
     * this screen found "Köhnə" from `köhnə` and not from `kohne` while the campaign directory
     * beside it found both. And an expression index only serves a query repeating the
     * expression exactly, so V63's `users_name_trgm_idx` and `users_slug_trgm_idx` -- built on
     * the fold, and used by the campaign directory's creator search -- could not serve this
     * one. V64 adds the third, over the address, because a disjunction is only as indexed as
     * its least indexed branch: leaving `lower(email)` in the OR would have left all three
     * predicates behind a sequential scan and made the other two indexes decorative.
     *
     * The term is matched against three columns and never against a name alone. Staff arrive
     * holding whatever the complaint gave them -- an address, a display name, or the slug out
     * of a profile URL -- and an endpoint that matched one of those would send them to guess
     * which.
     *
     * KEYSET, ON THE IDENTIFIER, in both. `Identifiers` mints UUID v7, so descending by
     * identifier is newest first and the cursor is the last row of the previous page. An offset
     * would drift as accounts are created underneath the reader, which on this list means a
     * moderator paging past the account they are looking for. `:after IS NULL` is left as it
     * was: unlike the term it does not gate the indexed predicates, so a generic plan applies
     * it as the filter it already is.
     *
     * Soft-deleted accounts are excluded from both, like every finder above. An account that
     * has been anonymised has nothing left to inspect, and suspending one would be a decision
     * about somebody the platform has finished forgetting.
