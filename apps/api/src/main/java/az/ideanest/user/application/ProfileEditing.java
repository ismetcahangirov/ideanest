/**
 * Reading and writing the owner's own profile — §4.2's P-01 to P-03 (#276).
 *
 * <p><strong>The write §4.2 said did not exist.</strong> {@code users.name}, {@code bio} and
 * {@code avatar_url} have been columns since V2 and nothing ever wrote one:
 * {@code User.setAvatarUrl} had no callers, and the only assignment to {@code bio} anywhere
 * was the {@code = null} inside {@code User.anonymise}. That absence is what §4.2's block
 * quote names as the reason the account navigation has no profile entry, and this class
 * removes it.
 *
 * <h2>Named paths, not a general account PATCH</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code ProfileVisibilityController} argues at length against {@code PATCH /v1/me} — "a
 * PATCH over the whole account is a surface every future field joins by default, and the
 * first one added without thinking becomes writable by anybody holding a token" — and that
 * argument is honoured here rather than quietly overturned by the first feature that would
 * have found it convenient. {@code /v1/me/profile} is a <em>second named path</em>, not the
 * general endpoint: what it writes is the six fields on {@link ProfileEdit}, and a column
 * added to {@code users} tomorrow joins this surface only if somebody puts it there on
 * purpose. The address is not writable here — §4.1's A-12 owns it and takes a confirmation
 * through the new mailbox, because moving an address is the last step of taking an account
 * over. The visibility is not writable here — P-07 has its own path. Neither is the slug,
 * and {@link OwnProfile#slug()} says why at length.
 *
 * <h2>No audit row</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code AuditLog} records privileged actions taken <em>over</em> an account, and this is
 * an account's owner editing their own page — the same position {@link PublicProfiles} takes
 * about P-07's switch and for the same reason: nothing here is destroyed on a schedule, and
 * everything is reversible by the person who did it, in the same request they did it with.
 * The deletion endpoints beside this one are audited because an appeal has to be readable
 * afterwards, and there is no appeal against having changed your own biography.
 *
 * <h2>What is refused, and why nothing is quietly fixed up</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link ProfileFieldRejectedException} carries that argument. Every rule below is also a
 * constraint in V2 or V46; enforcing it here is what turns the answer into a 400 that names
 * the field instead of a constraint violation surfacing as a 500.
 *
 * <p><strong>A refusal anywhere in an edit undoes all of it</strong>, because the whole
 * method is one transaction and {@link ProfileFieldRejectedException} is unchecked. That
 * matters more than it looks: the alternative — validate everything first, then write — reads
 * tidier and would still have to be a transaction, since the social links are rows in another
 * table. A partial save is the outcome neither design may produce, and the transaction is what
 * actually prevents it.
