/**
 * The profile editor's endpoints — §4.2's P-01 to P-03 (#276).
 *
 * <p><strong>Two named paths, and emphatically not {@code PATCH /v1/me}.</strong>
 * {@link ProfileVisibilityController} argues against a general account PATCH — "a PATCH over
 * the whole account is a surface every future field joins by default, and the first one added
 * without thinking becomes writable by anybody holding a token" — and this endpoint honours
 * that argument rather than being the feature that quietly overturns it.
 * {@code /v1/me/profile} names one thing and can only ever change that thing: the six fields
 * on {@link ProfilePatchRequest}. A column added to {@code users} next month is writable here
 * only if somebody adds it to that record on purpose.
 *
 * <p>That leaves this module with three controllers over one table plus the two account ones,
 * which is the file layout {@link PublicProfileController} defends: a public projection, an
 * owner's projection and a write do not share a class, so a public endpoint cannot acquire an
 * authenticated one's shape by being added next to it. This file is the owner's projection
 * <em>and</em> its write, together, because they are the same six fields in two directions —
 * {@code PublicProfiles} makes the same call about {@code requireVisible} and
 * {@code setVisibility} and gives the reason: a rule and the only surface that consults it
 * belong in one place.
 *
 * <h2>Authentication, and who is excluded by it</h2>
 *
 * <p>Neither path is named in {@code SecurityConfiguration}. Both therefore fall through to
 * its catch-all, which requires an authenticated caller <em>and</em> the standing an account
 * inside §17.4's deletion grace period does not have. That is the right answer and worth
 * stating, because a read looks at first like something such an account should keep: the three
 * paths a closing account may use are listed rather than derived — {@code /v1/me},
 * {@code /v1/me/export} and {@code /v1/me/deletion} — precisely so that adding an endpoint
 * never quietly adds a permission, and what a closing account would do with this one is edit a
 * page that is about to be anonymised.
 *
 * <h2>Caching</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code no-store} on both, and no validator. This is one person's own data behind a bearer
 * token, so there is no shared cache to serve and nothing here should be written to disk by an
 * intermediary — the same policy {@code /v1/me/export} and the backer's own archive carry, for
 * the same reason. The public profile's {@code public, no-cache} is the opposite choice and
 * {@link PublicProfileController} explains why it can afford to be.
