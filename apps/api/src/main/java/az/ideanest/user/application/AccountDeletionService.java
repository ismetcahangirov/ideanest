/**
 * Closing an account, and changing one's mind about it.
 *
 * <p><strong>Deletion is deferred, not immediate.</strong> §17.4 gives thirty
 * days before anything is destroyed. Two things make that period worth the
 * complexity: people delete accounts in anger and regret it the next morning,
 * and an attacker who has got hold of a session should not be able to make a
 * person's history disappear in one request. Neither is a hypothetical.
 *
 * <p><strong>The password is required.</strong> An access token is a
 * fifteen-minute bearer credential that a cross-site scripting bug, a shared
 * machine, or a proxy log can leak. A deletion that needs only that is a
 * vandalism tool. The password is the thing the account's owner knows, and it
 * is asked for at exactly the point where the answer cannot be undone.
 *
 * <p><strong>What the account can do during the grace period.</strong> It can
 * sign in — that is the way back — read itself, export its data, and cancel.
 * Nothing else: {@code SecurityConfiguration} refuses every other authenticated
 * request from a token issued to an account in this state. A closing account
 * that could still pledge would be making commitments it has already said it
 * will not be around to honour.
