/**
 * Whether an account has a public page, and the one switch that decides it — §4.2's P-04
 * and P-07 (#274, #282).
 *
 * <p><strong>The counterpart of {@code project.application.PublicProjects}, and built to
 * the same shape.</strong> That class answers "may a stranger see this campaign" and
 * keeps the answer in one place so that no public endpoint states the rule for itself;
 * this answers "may a stranger see this account", and it has the same reason to exist and
 * a stronger one. There are three public reads of a profile — the profile itself, the
 * campaigns this account created, the campaigns it backed — and they live in three
 * different modules, because {@code projects} and {@code pledges} are not this module's
 * tables. Written inline, the rule would be three copies in three modules, and the first
 * one that forgot {@link ProfileVisibility#PRIVATE} would publish the archive of somebody
 * who asked for no page at all.
 *
 * <p><strong>The read and the write are in one file, which is unusual here and is right
 * for this pair.</strong> {@link #requireVisible} enforces exactly what
 * {@link #setVisibility} sets, and nothing else in the service reads the column. Splitting
 * them would put a setting and the only rule that consults it in two files, which is how a
 * setting comes to be honoured on two surfaces out of three. The write is P-07's control
 * and it is the only write in this whole feature.
 *
 * <p><strong>404 and never 403</strong>, for all three of {@link ProfileNotFoundException}'s
 * cases. That file carries the argument.
 *
 * <h2>Why there is no {@code createdProjectsCount} and no {@code backedProjectsCount}</h2>
 *
 * <p>§4.2 puts both numbers on the page and neither is served, which is a decision worth
 * stating plainly rather than leaving as a gap somebody re-derives.
 *
 * <p>They cannot be answered from here. {@code projects} belongs to the project module and
 * {@code pledges} to the pledge module; {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} forbids reaching into
 * either, and the dependency it would take is one this module has never had — {@code user}
 * depends on nothing but {@code audit} and {@code shared} today, and every other module
 * depends on it. Making it depend on two of them turns the leaf of the graph into its
 * root, which is a cycle away from the modules stopping being extractable at all.
 *
 * <p>The sanctioned way across — a question published in {@code shared} and answered by
 * the module that owns the rows, as {@code ProjectSummaries} and {@code ProjectAudiences}
 * both are — was considered and refused for this. Those exist because a notification
 * <em>cannot</em> be written without the answer; a profile page can, and the count is
 * available to the client from the list it is already rendering. A published contract is a
 * permanent surface, and adding one to save a client an array length is how {@code shared}
 * acquires a feature.
 *
 * <p>Putting a {@code total} on the two list endpoints instead was the other candidate and
 * is worse in a way that only shows on the archive. The backed list drops what the reader
 * may not see — a campaign trust and safety has stopped, and a pledge the backer asked to
 * keep anonymous (§4.5's PL-12) — and a count that included them would be a number sitting
 * above a shorter list, which is the profile telling the reader that something is being
 * withheld from them. Reproducing every one of those exclusions in a second query is two
 * statements of one rule, and the one that falls behind is the one nobody reads. So the
 * lists are the count: what a client can show is what it was given.
