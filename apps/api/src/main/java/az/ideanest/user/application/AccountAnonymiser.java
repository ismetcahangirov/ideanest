/**
 * Anonymising one account, in one transaction.
 *
 * <p><strong>Anonymisation, not deletion.</strong> §17.4 says the grace period
 * ends in anonymisation and that financial records are kept for the statutory
 * period, and those two sentences are the same sentence. A pledge is a
 * financial record; "pledge #123 was made by user X" has to remain true after X
 * leaves, or the ledger no longer reconciles against the money that actually
 * moved. Every one of those rows is a foreign key to {@code users.id}, so the
 * row survives and its contents do not.
 *
 * <p><strong>What is overwritten:</strong> the email address, the display name,
 * the public slug, the avatar, the biography, the site, the location, every
 * social link, the proof that the address was verified, the password credential,
 * every unspent verification link, and the device label, user agent, and IP
 * address of every session.
 *
 * <p><strong>#276's four go with the rest of the profile, and §17.4 is not
 * satisfied without them.</strong> A row whose name reads "Deleted account" and
 * whose Instagram address is still attached has not been anonymised — a link to
 * somebody's account elsewhere identifies them more directly than the name above
 * it, since it resolves to a page with their photograph on it. The site and the
 * location are cleared by {@code User.anonymise} because they are columns on this
 * row; the links are deleted here, because an entity cannot delete rows in a table
 * it does not map. {@code ON DELETE CASCADE} on {@code user_social_links} is no
 * help and was never meant to be: {@code users} rows are never hard-deleted, which
 * is the whole point of anonymising rather than deleting.
 *
 * <p><strong>What survives:</strong> the row's identifier and timestamps, the
 * locale and currency (neither identifies anybody, and the currency is the unit
 * the retained financial rows are denominated in), the sessions themselves —
 * when they started and why they ended is a security record with no person left
 * in it — the hashes of refresh tokens, and every financial row that refers to
 * this identifier.
 *
 * <p>Separate from {@link AccountAnonymisationJob} for the same reason
 * {@code SessionRevoker} is separate: the transaction is per account, and a
 * self-invocation from the loop would not pass through the proxy, so the
 * annotation would be silently ignored and the whole batch would run in one
 * transaction — or in none.
