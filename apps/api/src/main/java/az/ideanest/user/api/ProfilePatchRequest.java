/**
 * A partial edit of the caller's own profile, with JSON Merge-Patch semantics (RFC 7396) —
 * §4.2's P-01 to P-03 (#276).
 *
 * <p>Every field is a {@link Patched}: one the client did not mention is left alone, and one
 * explicitly set to {@code null} is cleared. {@code ProjectPatchRequest} has the same shape
 * for the campaign editor, and {@link Patched} carries the argument — a profile form that
 * saved one field and let the absent keys read as "clear these" would delete somebody's
 * biography, their site and their links in a request that looks entirely ordinary in a log.
 *
 * <p>Bean validation annotations are deliberately absent, as on {@code ProjectPatchRequest}.
 * They cannot see inside a {@code Patched}, and a rule enforced here as well as in
 * {@code ProfileEditing} would be two rules that can disagree — with the service's version
 * being the one that also holds for every other caller. The lengths, the https rule and the
 * location vocabulary are checked there, and in the database beneath it.
 *
 * <p><strong>There is no {@code slug}, and no {@code email}, and no
 * {@code profileVisibility}.</strong> Each absence is a decision rather than a gap:
 * {@code OwnProfile.slug()} explains the first, §4.1's A-12 owns the second through a
 * confirmation sent to the new mailbox, and P-07 has its own path for the third. This is a
 * named endpoint over six fields, not the general {@code PATCH /v1/me} that
 * {@code ProfileVisibilityController} argues against.
 *
 * @param locationSlug one of V16's eighteen tokens — {@code baki}, {@code gence}. A slug
 *     rather than the name or an identifier: it is what the client already holds from the
 *     list it chose from, it is what {@code /discover?city=} takes, and one naming nothing is
 *     a 400 that says so rather than a field quietly dropped
 * @param socialLinks the whole list, or nothing. There is no add-one or remove-one — see
 *     {@code ProfileEdit}. An explicit {@code null} or an empty array removes every link
