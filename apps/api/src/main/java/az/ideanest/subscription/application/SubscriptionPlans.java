/**
 * The plan catalogue, read by everybody and changed by the console.
 *
 * <h2>Two audiences, and only one of them is authorised</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #onSale} is public and is what the pricing page renders. Everything else needs
 * {@link StaffCapability#CONFIGURE_PLATFORM}, which only {@code ADMINISTRATOR} holds —
 * the same capability AD-11's fee editor asks for, because what the platform charges a
 * creator to publish and what it charges a backer to pledge are the same kind of decision:
 * one screen, changing the behaviour of the running platform for everybody at once.
 *
 * <p>The capability is checked here rather than by an annotation on the controller,
 * following {@code FeeSchedules} and {@code AuditTrailController}: this is also where the
 * change is recorded, and an authorised action nobody recorded and a recorded action
 * nobody authorised are the same defect from opposite ends.
 *
 * <h2>Editing in place is deliberate, and is not what AD-11 does</h2>
 *
 * <p>A fee schedule is replaced rather than edited because a past payout was priced
 * against it. A plan is edited, because what a subscriber was charged is snapshotted onto
 * their own row at purchase — so nothing here can reach backwards into a bill. V62's
 * header carries the argument in full, including why the limits are <em>not</em>
 * snapshotted and therefore do move under everybody on the plan.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing is deleted</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #list} is how a plan leaves the catalogue. There is no delete endpoint and no
 * delete method: V62's {@code ON DELETE RESTRICT} would refuse one against any plan that
 * has ever been bought, and a plan nobody bought is one nobody misses when it is simply
 * unlisted.
