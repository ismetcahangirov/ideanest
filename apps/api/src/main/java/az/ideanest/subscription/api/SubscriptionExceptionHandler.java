/**
 * What the subscription endpoints refuse with — RFC 9457, as everything here is.
 *
 * <p>Scoped to the two controllers rather than global, for the reason every advice in this
 * service gives: an advice that catches {@code IllegalArgumentException} everywhere turns
 * a bug three modules away into a 400 that looks like the caller's fault.
 *
 * <p>The two staff refusals delegate to {@link StaffRefusals}, so that a console screen
 * branching on {@code INSUFFICIENT_STAFF_CAPABILITY} meets the same body on every screen.
 *
 * <p><strong>Every refusal carries a {@code code}.</strong> The pricing page and the
 * console branch on it — a client parsing a human sentence to decide what to draw is a
 * client that breaks when the sentence is translated, and §21.1 has four languages.
