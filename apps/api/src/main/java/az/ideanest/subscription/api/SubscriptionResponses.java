/**
 * What the pricing page and the console are told.
 *
 * <p><strong>Money travels as a string.</strong> §10.3 and CLAUDE.md: a JSON number is an
 * IEEE 754 double in every mainstream parser, and 19.90 is not representable in one. The
 * currency travels beside it rather than being assumed, because assuming one is how a
 * price list ends up saying the wrong number in the wrong place.
 *
 * <p><strong>A null limit is sent as null and not as a large number.</strong> The
 * unlimited case has to stay distinguishable on the wire, for the same reason it stays
 * distinguishable in {@code PublishingAllowance}: a client that compared against a
 * sentinel would eventually render "up to 2147483647 campaigns".
