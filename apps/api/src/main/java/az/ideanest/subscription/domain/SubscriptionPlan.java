/**
 * One thing the platform sells a creator — V62's row.
 *
 * <p><strong>Editable in place, unlike {@code FeeSchedule}, and the difference is worth
 * carrying in the reader's head.</strong> A fee schedule may not be edited because a past
 * payout was computed against it. A plan may be, because what a subscriber was charged is
 * copied onto their own {@link Subscription} at purchase — so editing this row cannot
 * reach backwards into anybody's bill.
 *
 * <p>What editing it <em>does</em> reach is the limits of everybody currently on it, which
 * are read live. V62 argues why that asymmetry is the right way round: raising a limit is
 * a gift to every subscriber, which is what an operator raising a limit means, and
 * lowering one reaches nobody retroactively because the gate refuses only new submissions.
 *
 * <p><strong>A plan is never deleted.</strong> {@link #isListed} is how one leaves the
 * catalogue. Deleting it would either orphan its subscribers or cascade them away, and
 * V62's foreign key restricts so that the sentence is enforced rather than merely
 * intended.
 *
 * <p><strong>Null limits mean no limit</strong>, in both of them. {@link
 * az.ideanest.shared.access.PublishingAllowance} has the argument against a sentinel.
