 * campaign submission and every load of the pricing page by a signed-in creator, and
 * {@code subscriptions_by_account} serves it.
 *
 * <p>It returns the <em>open</em> subscription and not the entitling one, deliberately.
 * The difference is a lapsed row: {@code entitlesAt} says no and the caller still needs to
 * see it, because "your Growth plan ended on 3 August" is a different sentence from "you
 * have never subscribed", and a query that filtered on the clock could not tell them
 * apart. V62's unique index guarantees there is at most one.
