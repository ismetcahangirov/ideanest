/**
 * What one account has bought, and until when — V62's row.
 *
 * <h2>The price is copied here; the limits are not</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #price}, {@link #currency} and {@link #billingPeriod} are snapshots taken at
 * purchase. The limits are read live from the plan, every time. V62's header has the full
 * argument; the short form is that a price that moved under a subscriber is a bill they
 * never agreed to, whereas a limit that moved is either a gift or a change that reaches
 * only their next submission.
 *
 * <h2>{@code ACTIVE} is not the same as entitled</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #entitlesAt} is the only question worth asking, and it consults the clock as
 * well as the state. V62 explains why no job marks a lapsed row {@code EXPIRED} on a
 * schedule: nothing reads the state without the period, so the job would exist to make a
 * column agree with a clock its readers already consult.
 *
 * <h2>A creator's cancellation is not staff's</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #cancelAtPeriodEnd} leaves the row {@code ACTIVE} and stops it renewing: the
 * creator paid for the month and taking it back the moment they click would be charging
 * for something and then withdrawing it. {@link #cancelNow} is the other one, and it is
 * staff ending a subscription — for a chargeback, a fraud finding, or a request to undo a
 * purchase somebody made by mistake.
