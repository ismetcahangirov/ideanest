/**
 * What the console's identifiers are called — issue #402, over HTTP.
 *
 * <p>{@link ConsoleDirectoryService} carries the argument for why this exists at all, why
 * it needs no capability beyond being staff, and why it is the one console read that is not
 * audited. What is decided here is the shape of the request.
 *
 * <p><strong>Repeated parameters rather than a comma-separated list.</strong>
 * {@code ?account=a&account=b} is what Spring binds to a {@code List<UUID>} without a
 * converter and what {@code createApiClient} already emits for an array — the client's own
 * test pins that behaviour, and a comma-joined value would be one identifier whose text
 * contains a comma.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code GET} with the identifiers in the query, not {@code POST} with a
 * body.</strong> It reads and changes nothing, so a method that says otherwise would put a
 * lookup behind every client's write path. The query does have a length ceiling — two
 * hundred UUIDs is around seven kilobytes — which is inside what every server on the path
 * accepts and is the same bound {@code ConsoleDirectoryService} enforces for its own
 * reasons.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code no-store}, like every other response under this prefix.</strong> Nothing
 * here is secret, but a console response held in a shared cache is one served to the next
 * reader of that cache, and the rule is worth more than the exception.
