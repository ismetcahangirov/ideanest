/**
 * The identifier lookup, when it refuses — #402.
 *
 * <p>Its own advice rather than an addition to {@link ConsoleExceptionHandler}, and the
 * reason is that handler's {@link IllegalArgumentException} mapping: it turns any such
 * failure into {@code UNKNOWN_LEDGER_ACCOUNT}, which is correct for the three surfaces it
 * is scoped to and would be a sentence about the ledger in front of somebody who asked for
 * a list of names. Scoping an advice narrowly is what makes that mapping safe, so widening
 * this one to reuse the 403 would cost the thing that made it worth writing.
