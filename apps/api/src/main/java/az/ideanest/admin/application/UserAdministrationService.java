/**
 * §4.11's AD-04 (#104): searching, inspecting, and stopping accounts.
 *
 * <h2>What this module adds, and why it is a module</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every fact here belongs to somebody else: {@code users} is the user module's table,
 * sessions are the auth module's, and staff identity is {@code shared.access}'s. What is
 * left is exactly what administration <em>is</em> — the authorisation, the audit row, and
 * the ordering between the two writes — and it is the reason this is a module rather than
 * three endpoints scattered across the modules that own the tables.
 *
 * <p><strong>A ban is two writes and they are one transaction.</strong> The account is
 * stopped and every session it holds is revoked. Either alone is a hole: an account
 * marked suspended whose refresh tokens still work is an account that can still be used
 * for as long as somebody keeps refreshing, and revoked sessions on an account that can
 * sign in again is an inconvenience rather than a ban.
 *
 * <p><strong>What a ban does not do is expire an access token that has already been
 * issued.</strong> They are signed and short-lived, {@code SecurityConfiguration} does not
 * consult the database on every request, and adding a lookup there would put a query on
 * the hot path of every endpoint to close a window of minutes. The window is stated rather
 * than hidden: a suspended account is refused at sign-in and at refresh, and its current
 * access token stops working when it expires.
 *
 * <h2>Why the search is audited</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link AuditAction#ACCOUNTS_SEARCHED} carries the argument. It is the one endpoint
 * that hands somebody else's email address to an account with no relationship to it, and
 * "who looked up whom" cannot be asked afterwards of a read nobody recorded.

     *
     * <p>{@code /admin/users} offered one control per row — suspend — and nothing else: no
     * link, no detail, no history. The screen's own copy told a moderator that suspending
     * "changes nothing about the campaigns they created or the pledges they made", which is
     * exactly the context needed to decide, and none of it was reachable from anywhere in
     * the console. This is the pledges half of that; the campaigns half is
     * {@code CampaignDirectory}'s new creator filter, and the standing was already served by
     * {@link #inspect}.
     *
     * <p><strong>The same list the person sees of themselves</strong>, from
     * {@link BackerArchive#pledgesOf}, unchanged. Not a narrower staff view: a moderator
     * about to stop somebody's account is deciding about the money that account has
     * committed, and a summary of it would be a second description that the decision would
     * then be taken against. Every state, and the campaign in whatever state it is in, for
     * the reason that method gives — a cancelled pledge and a refused card are what make the
     * row worth reading.
     *
     * <p><strong>Audited, and it has to be more carefully than the search is.</strong> This
     * hands one person's whole funding history to somebody with no relationship to them,
     * which is a sharper disclosure than the address {@link AuditAction#ACCOUNTS_SEARCHED}
     * exists for. The action is that same one — a read of an account, recorded against the
     * account rather than the reader, exactly as {@link #inspect} records itself — and the
     * detail says which read it was, so the trail can tell "looked them up" from "read
     * everything they have ever paid for".
     *
     * <p><strong>The account is checked first.</strong> An identifier naming nothing is a 404
     * rather than an empty page: "this person has backed nothing" and "there is no such
     * person" are different answers, and a moderator acting on the first when the second is
     * true is acting on a typo.
