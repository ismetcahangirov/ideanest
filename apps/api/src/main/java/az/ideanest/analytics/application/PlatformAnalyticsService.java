/**
 * The platform's own figures — §4.11's AD-13, issue #313.
 *
 * <h2>What made this unblockable</h2>
 *
 * <p>#313 says "#95 aggregates one campaign, not the platform", which is true and is not
 * the same as "there is no data". V27 writes one row per campaign per day; the platform's
 * volume is that table grouped by day instead of by campaign, and the whole of this service
 * is that regrouping plus the two figures the rollups cannot answer.
 *
 * <h2>What is deliberately not built</h2>
 *
 * <p>§4.11's AD-13 lists "volume, success rate, average pledge, cohorts, funnels". The
 * first three are here. <strong>Cohorts and funnels are not</strong>, and that is stated
 * rather than approximated: a cohort is a retention question — do backers who arrived in
 * March still back campaigns in June — and answering it needs a rollup keyed on the
 * backer's first pledge, which does not exist. A funnel needs the visit-to-pledge path,
 * and {@code referral_touches} records where somebody came from rather than what they did
 * next.
 *
 * <p>Approximating them from what is here would produce two numbers on a dashboard that
 * look like cohorts and funnels and are not, which is worse than the two panels the screen
 * shows saying what they are waiting for. That is the same rule the console index follows
 * for its blocked modules.
 *
 * <h2>{@code VIEW_FINANCE} rather than a capability of its own</h2>
 *
 * <p>These are revenue figures. {@code StaffCapability} folds AD-05 and AD-13 into one
 * authority deliberately: reading the payment log and reading what it adds up to are the
 * same facts at two levels of detail, and a moderator who could see the platform's monthly
 * volume but not the charges behind it would have the more sensitive half of the pair.
 *
 * <h2>One currency, and it says so</h2>
 *
 * <p>§21.2 refuses to convert between currencies for anything that moves money, and a
 * figure a director reads is not exempt. Everything is summed in the platform currency and
 * the pledges left out are counted and reported — a total with a silent exclusion is worse
 * than one with a stated gap.
