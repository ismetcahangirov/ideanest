/**
 * V27's rollups, summed across the platform rather than within a campaign — issue #313.
 *
 * <h2>Its own class rather than methods on {@code DailyRollupRepository}</h2>
 *
 * <p>That one is #95's, and every statement in it is scoped to a campaign — which is the
 * whole of what makes it a creator's view. Adding platform-wide sums beside them would
 * leave one repository whose methods answer two different questions, and the first caller
 * to pick the wrong one would show a creator the platform's revenue.
 *
 * <h2>{@code NamedParameterJdbcTemplate}, like its neighbour</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code project_analytics_daily} has no JPA entity: it is written by a single
 * {@code INSERT … SELECT} in {@code DailyRollupRepository} and read as aggregates. Mapping
 * it would mean an entity loaded and discarded for every row of every sum, and a repository
 * interface whose managed type exists only to satisfy Spring Data.
 *
 * <h2>Every query is filtered by currency</h2>
 *
 * <p>§21.2 refuses to convert between currencies for anything that moves money, and a
 * figure a director reads is not exempt: a total that added manat to dollars would be a
 * number nobody can reconcile against the ledger. {@link #otherCurrencyPledges} counts what
 * was left out, so the response can state the gap rather than hide it.
