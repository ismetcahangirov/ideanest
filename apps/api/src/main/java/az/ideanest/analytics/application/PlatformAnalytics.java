/**
 * The platform's own figures — §4.11's AD-13, issue #313.
 *
 * <p>#313 was blocked on "#95 aggregates one campaign, not the platform", and that is
 * exactly right: {@code ProjectAnalytics} answers a creator asking how their campaign is
 * doing, and every query behind it is filtered by {@code project_id}. What this answers is
 * a different question with the same nouns — how the platform is doing — and the rows it
 * reads are the same daily rollups, summed the other way.
 *
 * <p><strong>Every figure here is derived from rollups that already exist.</strong> That is
 * what made this unblockable without new tables: V27 writes one row per campaign per day,
 * and "volume across the platform" is that table grouped by day instead of by campaign.
 *
 * @param from the first day counted, inclusive
 * @param to the last, inclusive
 * @param computedAt when this was read, so a stale tab is not mistaken for a live figure
 * @param totals the headline numbers over the whole window
 * @param daily one point per day, for the chart
 * @param outcomes how campaigns that closed in the window ended — §4.11's "success rate"
