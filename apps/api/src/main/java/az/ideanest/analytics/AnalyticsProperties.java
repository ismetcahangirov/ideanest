     * The three numbers the attribution rule is tuned by.
     *
     * @param attributionWindow <strong>how long a visit stays evidence.</strong>
     *     Thirty days, which is the interval this category of purchase is actually
     *     decided over: a backer who reads about a campaign, waits for a payday and
     *     comes back was still brought here by whoever told them. The two failure
     *     directions are not symmetrical — too short and the report credits "direct"
     *     for work somebody did, which makes a creator stop doing the thing that is
     *     working; too long and it credits a channel for a visit nobody remembers,
     *     which makes them keep spending. Thirty days is short enough that the second
     *     is bounded and long enough that the first is rare.
     *     <p>Changing it changes visits recorded from then on and cannot rewrite a
     *     report, because the window is frozen onto each row — see
     *     {@code ReferralTouch} and V24
     * @param repeatVisitInterval <strong>how long the same source from the same
     *     visitor is one visit.</strong> A person reading a campaign page reloads it,
     *     opens two tabs, and comes back from the same tweet three times in an
     *     afternoon; each of those is the same fact and recording it three times
     *     inflates nothing in the report — the rule takes one touch — but does turn
     *     the evidence table into a hit counter. Thirty minutes is the conventional
     *     session length and is what makes "a visit" mean something
     * @param maxSources <strong>how many rows a report may name.</strong> The
     *     labels on a visit are free text a link carried, so the number of distinct
     *     sources is bounded by what anybody chose to put in a URL rather than by
     *     anything the platform controls. Beyond this the remainder is folded into
     *     one {@code OTHER} row, so the shares still add up to a hundred and a
     *     creator's dashboard cannot be filled with somebody else's noise
     * @param visitsPerAddress §17.3's shape applied to an unauthenticated write: how
     *     many visits one source address may record in a window. The capture endpoint
     *     is reachable by anybody — that is what makes it a visit counter and not a
     *     signed-in event — so it is the rate limiter that stands between it and
     *     whoever wants to fill a creator's report
     * @param window the period the visit budget is counted over
