 * reason every other advice in the service gives: an advice that catches a broad type
 * across the whole application turns a bug somewhere else into a tidy 4xx and hides
 * it.
 *
 * <p>Every response carries a {@code code} as well as a status, per §10.4. The status
 * tells a client how to behave; the code tells it what happened, and it is what a
 * client branches on — two different 409s that cannot be told apart force clients to
