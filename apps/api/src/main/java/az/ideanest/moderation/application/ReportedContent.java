/**
 * The evidence behind one report — #399.
 *
 * <h2>A third read, not a wider one</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code ReportModerationService.report} serves the complaint and its decision history,
 * and this serves what the complaint is about. Two services rather than one field added to
 * {@link QueuedReport}, because that record is also every row of the queue: assembling the
 * comment, its author and its campaign for twenty-five rows is twenty-five lookups nobody
 * reads, on the one screen in the console that has to stay fast enough to work from.
 *
 * <p>The detail page already reads the report and its audit trail independently, so that a
 * trail which fails to load costs a line of text rather than the screen. This is the third
 * read in that arrangement and it degrades the same way — a moderator who cannot load the
 * evidence should be told the evidence is missing, and should still see the report.
 *
 * <h2>The refusal is here, and it is the queue's own</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code requireStaff}, matching {@code ReportModerationService.report} exactly. This
 * endpoint says nothing about a report that a moderator holding the report cannot already
 * see, so a stricter check would refuse somebody the evidence for a decision they are
 * entitled to take. Checked before the report is loaded, so a caller who is not staff
 * learns nothing about which report identifiers are real.
 *
 * <h2>Every kind of target is answered, including the two with nothing to inline</h2>
 *
 * <p>A campaign and an account are reached directly by the console — the staff preview at
 * {@code /admin/campaigns/{id}} renders a campaign in any state, and a profile has a public
 * page — so this returns {@link ReportedItem.State#ADDRESSED_DIRECTLY} for them rather than
 * a 404 or an empty body. One shape for four kinds is what lets the screen render the
 * answer without knowing which kind it asked about.
