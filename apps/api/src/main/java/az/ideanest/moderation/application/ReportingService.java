/**
 * The only way a report is made.
 *
 * <p><strong>Reporting is idempotent per reporter per target, and the database is
 * what makes it so.</strong> The requirement — a reporter must not be able to
 * multiply their own report on one thing — cannot be met by reading first and
 * inserting second: two taps on a slow connection both see no open report, both
 * insert, and the campaign now carries two complaints from one person. Since the
 * only triage signal the queue has is how many people reported a thing, that is not
 * a cosmetic duplicate; it is the signal being writable by whoever is attacking it.
 * So the insert is an {@code ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING} against V23's partial unique
 * index, and the read below it is an optimisation rather than the check.
 *
 * <p><strong>A repeat report is a success, not a 409.</strong> The reporter did what
 * they meant to do, the platform has their complaint, and telling them otherwise
 * would train people to report the same thing from a second account. What they get
 * back is the report already on file, unchanged — including its original reason and
 * date, because rewriting either would let somebody move their own report up a queue
 * ordered by arrival.
 *
 * <p><strong>What is deliberately not here.</strong> Nothing is notified, nothing is
 * hidden, and nothing about the target changes. A report is a request for a person
 * to look, and auto-hiding on a report count is the mechanism by which a competitor
 * takes a campaign down with fifty free accounts. Acting on a report is AD-02's
 * suspension and AD-04's ban, each of which is a separate privileged action with its
 * own audit row.
