/**
 * How somebody tells the platform that something is wrong. §4.9's C-06 and C-07, and
 * §10.2's {@code POST /v1/projects/{id}/report}.
 *
 * <p><strong>Three endpoints on one controller, because they are one feature and one
 * budget.</strong> Splitting them would mean three rate limiters to keep in step, and
 * somebody who had spent their reporting allowance on campaigns could then spend a
 * second one on people and a third on comments.
 *
 * <p><strong>No endpoint here appears in {@code SecurityConfiguration}, and that is
 * the intended arrangement.</strong> All three fall through to the catch-all rule, so
 * all three require a bearer token from an account that is not inside §17.4's deletion
 * grace period. Reporting is one of the few writes where requiring an account is not
 * friction but the mechanism: the duplicate suppression this feature is built on is
 * unstateable without an identity to compare, and V23's header has the other two
 * reasons.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code POST /v1/updates/{id}/report} is published as of #297</strong>, which
 * was the last of AD-09's three surfaces without one. See {@link #reportUpdate}.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code POST /v1/comments/{id}/report} is published as of #84.</strong> It
 * was absent because there was no {@code comments} table for an identifier to be
 * checked against, and accepting a report a moderator could never look at shows the
 * reporter a success for nothing. {@link ReportTargetType#COMMENT} was already in the
 * taxonomy and in V23's check constraint, so this cost a controller method and no
 * migration — which is the whole of the bet #102 made when it enumerated the value
 * early. Deduplication is unchanged and is still V23's partial unique index: a
 * comment is a target like any other, so a second report on one comment by one
 * reporter is the same 202 carrying the report already on file.
 *
 * <p><strong>Rate limiting is here rather than in the service</strong>, following
 * {@code PrelaunchController} and {@code AuthController}: it is about the transport —
 * a source address, a 429, a {@code Retry-After} — and the service should not have to
 * know it is being reached over HTTP.
