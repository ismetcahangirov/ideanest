/**
 * Whether there is anything at that identifier worth reporting.
 *
 * <p><strong>The check is not optional, and it is not about correctness of
 * data.</strong> Without it the endpoint accepts a report about any UUID a client
 * cares to invent, which is two problems: the queue fills with rows a moderator
 * opens, cannot find anything behind, and closes; and the endpoint becomes an oracle
 * — a caller who could report an identifier and be told "accepted" would learn that
 * the identifier names something, which for a draft campaign is exactly what
 * {@code ProjectAccess} spends its class comment refusing to say.
 *
 * <p><strong>Each module answers for its own surface.</strong> A campaign is
 * resolved through {@code PublicProjects}, which already encodes §6.1's nine public
 * states and answers 404 for a draft and for a suspended campaign alike; an account
 * through {@code UserAccounts}, which excludes soft-deleted rows; a comment through
 * {@code PublicComments} (#84), which excludes tombstones and asks
 * {@code PublicProjects} the same question about the campaign it is under. No rule is
 * restated here, because a second copy of "which campaigns may a stranger see" is
 * the copy that forgets {@code SUSPENDED} the next time the list changes.
 *
 * <p><strong>A suspended campaign is deliberately unreportable.</strong> It reads
 * oddly for a safety feature until you notice what a suspension is: trust and safety
 * has already stopped that campaign, so a further report about it adds a row to the
 * queue and no information. The reporter gets the same 404 anybody else browsing
 * gets, which is consistent rather than special. A removed comment is refused for the
 * identical reason, and {@code PublicComments} makes the argument there.
