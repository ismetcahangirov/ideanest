/**
 * The queue, and the only way a report is decided.
 *
 * <p><strong>Three things happen together or not at all</strong> when a report is
 * resolved: the caller is established as platform staff, the row is moved out of
 * {@code OPEN} by a statement that refuses to move one twice, and an
 * {@code audit_logs} row is written in the same transaction. That last clause is the
 * point of doing this in a service rather than in the controller —
 * {@code AuditLog#record} is {@code MANDATORY} precisely so that "the report was
 * upheld and nobody recorded who upheld it" is not a state this code can reach.
 *
 * <p><strong>Who counts as staff is asked through {@link PlatformStaff}.</strong> There
 * is no role model until epic #100, and what stands in for one is the configured
 * address list that {@code ProjectModerationController} already checks. Keeping a
 * second list here would be two answers to "who is staff", which is the kind of
 * disagreement nobody notices until one of the two is out of date and somebody can
 * decide reports and not campaigns.
 *
 * <p>Asked through the contract in {@code shared.access} rather than by naming the
 * project module's {@code ModeratorDirectory} directly, which is what this module did
 * before #236. The dependency on that module's {@code application} layer was legal —
 * it is the boundary {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} allows — but it was on a class, and
 * epic #100 replaces the class. Depending on the question instead means #100 changes
 * one file rather than every module that had to know who is staff.
 *
 * <p><strong>A decision is not an action.</strong> Upholding a report records that
 * the complaint was justified. It does not suspend the campaign, ban the account, or
 * remove anything — those are AD-02's and AD-04's own privileged actions, with their
 * own state machines and their own audit rows, and folding them in here would mean a
 * moderator could not agree with a report without also taking a campaign down.
