     * <p><strong>One statement, because everything difficult about this is decided
     * inside it.</strong> A claim written as a read followed by an update cannot be
     * made correct: two replicas read a row whose lease has expired, both conclude it
     * is theirs, and both run the job — and the second run is not a duplicate
     * anybody chose, it is a duplicate nobody can see. So the condition lives in the
     * statement and PostgreSQL serialises it. Under {@code READ COMMITTED} the second
     * writer blocks on the row lock, re-reads the row the first one committed, finds
     * a lease that has not expired, and matches nothing — which is the same mechanism
     * {@code VerificationTokenRepository#claim} and {@code ReservationExpiry} rely on,
     * and the reason neither of them needs a lock either.
     *
     * <p>Three conditions, and each of them is a different way of not running:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code state = 'READY'} — the job has not given up. A dead job is not
     *       triggered at all, so a poisoned sweep stops costing a database round trip
     *       per tick per replica.
     *   <li>{@code next_attempt_at <= :now} — its backoff has elapsed. This is what
     *       makes a failing job quieten down without anybody editing its cron.
     *   <li>the lease is absent or elapsed — nobody else is in it. An elapsed lease is
     *       reclaimed on the spot, which is the whole answer to a holder that died
     *       mid-run: the job resumes by itself, at most one lease late.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Native rather than JPQL because the row has to be judged against the values
     * it holds now, not against an entity somebody loaded a moment ago — and because
     * a JPQL update on a locked row would still be a read and a write from the
     * persistence context's point of view.
     *
     * @return 1 if this caller now holds the job, 0 if it does not — and the caller
     *     cannot tell which of the three reasons applied, deliberately: all three mean
     *     the same thing to a trigger, which is to do nothing until the next tick
