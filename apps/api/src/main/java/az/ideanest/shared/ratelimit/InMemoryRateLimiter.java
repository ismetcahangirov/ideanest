/**
 * A sliding-window rate limiter held in this process's heap.
 *
 * <p><strong>This is correct for one instance and wrong for two.</strong> Two
 * replicas each enforce the limit separately, so the effective limit is the
 * configured one multiplied by the number of instances — "5 per 15 minutes"
 * across three replicas is fifteen — and a client that reconnects lands wherever
 * the load balancer sends it. The shared counter belongs in the shared storage
 * of #134; until then this is honest protection against a script and no
 * protection against a botnet, and the deployment is single-instance anyway.
 * Nothing outside this package knows which it is talking to, which is what makes
 * that swap a bean definition rather than an edit to every call site.
 *
 * <p>A sliding window rather than a fixed one because a fixed window lets twice
 * the limit through across a boundary: five attempts at 14:59:59 and five more
 * at 15:00:00 is ten in one second against a limit of five per fifteen minutes.
