/**
 * What may never be written to a log, removed from a line that was about to be.
 *
 * <p>§17.4: "Personal data in logs — redacted: email, phone, address, card,
 * token, password". This is that rule as code, and it is applied by
 * {@link RedactingEncoder} to the bytes an appender was going to emit rather
 * than by each call site. That choice is the whole design: a rule that depends
 * on every {@code log.info} remembering it is a rule that holds until the first
 * afternoon somebody logs a request object to find out what is in it.
 *
 * <p><strong>Over-masking is the safe direction.</strong> Where a value's
 * boundary is ambiguous — free text after {@code name=}, say — the rules take
 * more rather than less. A line that says less than it could is a debugging
 * inconvenience; a line that names a backer and their address is a breach.
 *
 * <p>Two kinds of rule, because personal data arrives in two shapes.
 *
 * <p><strong>By field name.</strong> {@code password=…}, {@code "city":"…"},
 * {@code recoveryCodes=[…]}. The name is the evidence, and this is what catches
 * a full name or a street — neither of which has a pattern to match. The names
 * are the ones this codebase actually uses: {@code auth.api}'s requests,
 * {@code pledge}'s shipping fields, {@code user.domain.User}.
 *
 * <p><strong>By shape.</strong> An address, a card, a phone number, and a JWT
 * are recognisable wherever they appear — including inside an object's
 * {@code toString}, an exception message, or a stack trace, which is exactly
 * where the field-name rules cannot reach.
 *
 * <p>What is deliberately <em>not</em> masked: the correlation identifiers,
 * amounts, currencies, states, and the account identifier. §18.1 requires them
 * on every line, and a pseudonymous UUID is what makes a log joinable without
 * naming anybody. The card rules are keyed on issuer prefix and Luhn precisely
 * so that a thirteen-digit epoch timestamp is not mistaken for a card.
