/**
 * What happens when a trigger fires: claim, run, record.
 *
 * <p>Three lines, because everything difficult is on either side of them —
 * {@link JobRecordRepository#claim} decides who runs, and {@link JobLease} decides
 * where the transactions are. This is the part that must not have a transaction of
 * its own, so that the work happens with nothing held open.
 *
 * <p><strong>A tick that claims nothing is not an error.</strong> On a fleet of
 * three replicas, two of every three ticks do exactly nothing, which is the design
 * working: sixteen jobs on three replicas is forty-eight timers and sixteen runs.
