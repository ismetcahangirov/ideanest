/**
 * What a member of platform staff may do, named one authority at a time — #295.
 *
 * <p><strong>This is {@link ProjectCapability}'s argument applied to the other kind of
 * authority.</strong> That enum exists because four modules wanted a fine-grained
 * permission check, could not name the project module's own enum, and each settled for
 * the coarsest question the project module happened to publish. Staff authorisation was
 * in a worse position: there was no fine-grained question to ask at all, only
 * {@link PlatformStaff#requireStaff}, so every console endpoint asked "is this person
 * staff" and got the same answer whether it was about a comment or about a refund.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why the vocabulary is here and the roles are not.</strong> A capability is
 * named by the module that enforces it — the refund console says
 * {@code ISSUE_REFUND} — so it has to live somewhere every module may name, which is
 * {@code shared}. Which roles confer which capabilities is a policy the staff module
 * owns and nothing else needs to know; a caller that named a role would be re-deciding
 * that policy at the call site, and the fifth one to do it would get it wrong.
 *
 * <p><strong>They are deliberately coarser than the endpoint list.</strong> Sixteen
 * console modules do not need sixteen capabilities: reading the payment log and reading
 * the ledger are the same authority over the same facts, and splitting them would
 * produce a grant screen nobody can reason about. The line drawn here is "could a
 * mistake with this be undone", which is why reading finance and moving money are two
 * and not one.
