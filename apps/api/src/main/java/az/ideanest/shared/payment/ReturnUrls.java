/**
 * Which return addresses may be handed to a payment provider — issue #139.
 *
 * <p>{@code POST /v1/pledges/{id}/payment} and {@code POST /v1/me/payout-destination/card-registration}
 * take a {@code successUrl} and an {@code errorUrl} from the caller and forward them to the provider,
 * which redirects the person there from its own page. Unchecked, that is an open redirect running
 * through the payment flow: a compromised front end or a browser extension could send a backer from
 * the bank's page to a look-alike "payment failed, re-enter your card" site, and the link would look
 * like ours because the redirect came from checkout.
 *
 * <p>So an address is accepted only when it is absolute, carries no user information, and its
 * scheme, host and port are exactly those of a configured origin ({@link ReturnUrlProperties}). The
 * path and query are the caller's: the web returns to {@code /{locale}/pledges/{id}?payment=…} and
 * {@code /{locale}/settings/payout?card=…}, and neither is the platform's business to enumerate. An
 * absent address is accepted too, because both fields are optional and the provider then uses the
 * return pages configured in the merchant account.
 *
 * <p><strong>Configured origins are https.</strong> The one exception is a loopback host —
 * {@code http://localhost:3000} is the default site origin and what a developer runs — because no
 * third party can serve a page on somebody else's loopback. {@code http} on any other host is
 * refused: a return over plain http can be rewritten by anybody on the network path.
 *
 * <p><strong>No custom schemes</strong> ({@code ideanest://}). Nobody has confirmed that the provider
 * redirects to one, and the native application returns through an https page on the site instead —
 * {@code docs/architecture.md} §9.4 records the decision.
 *
 * <p><strong>Loopback only, outside development, is logged loudly.</strong> {@code WEB_BASE_URL}
 * defaults to {@code http://localhost:3000}, and that is a valid origin, so a deployment that forgot
 * the variable starts cleanly and then refuses every real return address — a payment outage with
 * nothing in the log. The service still starts (a start-up refusal would take down everything else
 * the API serves over one variable), but it says so at WARN. See
 * {@link #looksDeployed(Environment)} for how "outside development" is told.
 *
 * <p><strong>Every refusal is logged</strong> at WARN with the field and the host, never the path or
 * query: those are the caller's and may carry anything, including an attacker's link.
