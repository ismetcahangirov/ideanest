/**
 * The transactional half of the scheduler: taking a job, and writing down how it
 * went.
 *
 * <p><strong>Three short transactions around one run, and never a transaction that
 * spans it.</strong> The obvious implementation — {@code SELECT … FOR UPDATE} held
 * until the work finishes — would be simpler and is the wrong shape: the run's
 * duration would become a transaction's duration, pinning a pool connection and a
 * snapshot for the whole pass, and PostgreSQL cannot vacuum past the oldest open
 * transaction. A sweep that takes a minute would hold the horizon back by a minute,
 * every minute. So the lock is a lease written into a row and committed
 * immediately, and the run happens with nothing held open.
 *
 * <p>A separate bean from {@link JobRunner} rather than methods on it, because
 * Spring's {@code @Transactional} is a proxy and a self-call carries no transaction
 * at all — which, for a class whose entire job is where the transaction boundaries
 * are, would leave them nowhere. {@code OutboxDispatch} is split from
 * {@code OutboxRelay} for the same reason.
 *
 * <p><strong>Every write checks that the lease is still ours.</strong> That is what
 * makes an expiring lease safe rather than merely convenient: a replica paused past
 * its expiry — a long stop-the-world pause, a stalled disk — must not come back and
 * clear a lease that now belongs to somebody else, because the replica that took the
 * job is still in it and a third one would then start the same work.
