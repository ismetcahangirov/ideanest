/**
 * The names the web client files its cached public pages under — issue #127.
 *
 * <p>This is one half of a contract with two spellings, and the other half is
 * {@code apps/web/src/lib/cache/tags.ts}. There is no way to share it: the two live in
 * different languages in different processes, and generating one from the other would be a
 * build-time dependency between a Spring service and a Next application for six string
 * templates. So it is duplicated on purpose, the way {@code LedgerAccount} duplicates V41's
 * check constraint, and for the same reason — the rule is enforced on the far side, and this
 * is how the near side refuses to produce something the far side would reject.
 *
 * <p><strong>The web client refuses a tag it does not recognise and says which.</strong> That
 * is what makes the duplication safe to have: a tag misspelled here comes back as a 400 naming
 * it, in a log line, rather than as a page that quietly never refreshes.
 *
 * <h2>Two names for one campaign, and both are needed</h2>
 *
 * <p>The campaign's public page is read by its address, before the client knows the identifier
 * behind it, so {@code campaign:{creatorSlug}/{projectSlug}} is the only tag that read can
 * carry. Everything hanging off the campaign — its rewards, updates, comments and questions —
 * is read by identifier and carries {@code project:{id}}. An event knows the identifier, so
 * {@link #forCampaign} composes both and needs the slugs from
 * {@link az.ideanest.shared.project.ProjectSummaries} to do it.

     * interesting traffic level, bought with a reader seeing a slightly older ordering of
     * campaigns they have not chosen yet. The feed keeps the sixty-second window both sides
     * already hold, and callers add {@code DISCOVERY} for the events that change what is
     * <em>in</em> it rather than what order it is in.
