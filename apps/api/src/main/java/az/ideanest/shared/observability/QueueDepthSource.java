/**
 * How much work is waiting in one queue, answered by the module that owns it — §4.11's
 * AD-16, issue #316.
 *
 * <p><strong>This is {@code ProjectAudienceSource}'s shape, and it is here for the same
 * reason.</strong> AD-16's screen wants the depth of every queue on the platform, and the
 * queues live in three modules — the outbox and the job runner in {@code shared}, email
 * delivery in {@code notification}. A health service that read those tables itself would
 * be reaching into other modules' infrastructure, which {@code ModuleBoundaryTests}
 * forbids and which would make adding a queue a change to a module that does not own it.
 *
 * <p>So the asking side names this interface and the owning side implements it. A new
 * queue appears on the screen by adding a bean, and the screen needs no edit at all.
 *
 * <p><strong>Both counts, never one.</strong> A deep queue is a platform under load; a
 * dead row is a platform that has given up and will not recover without somebody. A single
 * number would let a thousand-item backlog hide one message that will never be sent —
 * {@code SystemHealth.QueueDepth} grades them differently for exactly that reason.

     *
     * <p><strong>It used to be the words a member of staff uses, and #405 is what that
     * cost.</strong> The console rendered "Outbox" and "Scheduled jobs" verbatim under an
     * Azerbaijani heading, directly above a section headed with the Azerbaijani for the
     * second of them — one concept in two languages on one screen. A name a screen can
     * render without a catalogue is one that can only ever be in one language, and §21.1
     * says which language a service's own strings are in until it is translated.
