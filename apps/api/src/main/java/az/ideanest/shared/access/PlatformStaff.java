/**
 * Who counts as platform staff, asked from outside the module that currently knows.
 *
 * <p><strong>A second question, not a second interface for the same one.</strong>
 * {@link ProjectAuthorisation} answers "what has this campaign's creator granted this
 * account"; this answers "does this account work for the platform". They are different
 * kinds of authority — one is delegated by a user, the other is conferred by the
 * operator — and a moderator holds no capability on the campaign they are deciding
 * about, which is the point.
 *
 * <p><strong>The implementation is a role model since #295</strong>
 * ({@code staff.application.StaffDirectory}), and the prediction this comment used to
 * carry held exactly: the callers ask through an interface in {@code shared} rather than
 * naming the directory, so replacing what is behind it moved the implementation between
 * modules and changed no call site's shape.
 *
 * <p>It still fails closed. An account with no granted role and no bootstrap entry holds
 * nothing, so a deployment that configures neither has a console nobody can open rather
 * than one anybody can.
 *
 * <p><strong>Two questions, not one, and that is what #295 added.</strong>
 * {@link #isStaff} asks whether somebody works here; {@link #requireCapability} asks
 * whether this particular authority is theirs. Before the role model only the first
 * existed, so every console endpoint asked it — and a moderator hired to clear the
 * comment queue could issue a refund, because there was no narrower question to ask.
 * A caller that means to guard a privileged action names the capability; {@link
 * #requireStaff} remains for the surfaces where the answer really is "any member of
 * staff", such as reading the audit trail.
 *
 * <p>{@link #requireStaff} refuses with
 * {@code staff.application.NotAModeratorException} and {@link #requireCapability} with
 * that or {@code staff.application.InsufficientStaffCapabilityException} — both 403.
 * Described rather than declared for {@link ProjectAuthorisation}'s reason:
 * {@code shared} may not depend on a module.
