/**
 * Puts every {@link ScheduledJob} on a timer, and every timer behind a lease.
 *
 * <p><strong>Spring's {@code TaskScheduler} is still the clock.</strong> #134 is not
 * a replacement for the timer — an in-process timer is fine, and a fleet of them is
 * a feature: sixteen jobs on three replicas is forty-eight triggers, of which
 * sixteen do the work and thirty-two find the job already claimed. What was missing
 * was the claim, and that is the only thing this package adds. It is also why no
 * dependency arrived with it: PostgreSQL and a cron expression are the whole
 * mechanism, and ShedLock or Quartz would bring a second scheduler, a second set of
 * tables, and a second place to look when a job did not run.
 *
 * <p><strong>Registered after the application is ready</strong>, not during the
 * refresh. A trigger that fired while beans were still being created would run work
 * against a half-built context, and the first tick of {@code outbox-relay} is one
 * second after the timer exists.
 *
 * <p>Correlation comes from {@code ObservabilityConfiguration}, which puts
 * {@code CorrelationTaskDecorator} on this very scheduler: the decorator is applied
 * per execution, so each pass of each job carries its own identifiers and a sweep's
 * log lines can be gathered by something other than their timestamps.
 *
 * <p><strong>What is deliberately not here</strong>: nothing schedules a job it was
 * not given. There is no registry to call, no annotation to remember, and no way to
 * run a job on a timer without also giving it a lease — which is the only property
 * that makes the count of replicas stop mattering.
