/**
 * Work that happens on a schedule, on one replica at a time.
 *
 * <p>A job implements this instead of carrying {@code @Scheduled}. The difference is
 * the whole of #134: the annotation fires on every replica and records nothing,
 * whereas a job registered here is claimed before it runs, counted when it fails,
 * and stopped when it has failed too often.
 *
 * <p><strong>Implemented by the module that owns the work, never by this package.</strong>
 * {@code shared} may not depend on {@code pledge} or {@code project} — that is
 * {@code ModuleBoundaryTests}' rule and it exists so that a module can be extracted
 * later — so the dependency points this way: a job knows about the scheduler and the
 * scheduler knows only about this interface. It is also the arrangement that keeps
 * the sweep and its trigger in the same file, which is where somebody looking for
 * "when does this run" will look.
 *
 * <p>Implementations are found by type. A {@code @Component} implementing this is on
 * the scheduler; nothing else has to be registered anywhere.

     * <p>Throwing is how a run reports that it failed. The runner counts the attempt,
