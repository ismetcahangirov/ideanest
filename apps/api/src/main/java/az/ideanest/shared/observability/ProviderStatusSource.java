 * {@code SystemHealthService} read {@code payment.application.ProviderCircuitBreaker}
 * directly — which compiled, and which {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} refused, because naming
 * the breaker means naming {@code payment.domain.ProviderName} to iterate over it.
 *
 * <p>That rule was doing real work. A health screen that knew the provider vocabulary would
 * have to change every time §9.3's list of integrations did, for a page that only ever
 * renders whatever it is handed. So the payment module answers with strings it chooses, and
 * the platform module renders them.
 *
 * <p>The same arrangement makes a second answerer free: a mail relay or a media provider
 * that grew a health check would appear on the screen by implementing this, with no edit to
 * the module that draws it.
