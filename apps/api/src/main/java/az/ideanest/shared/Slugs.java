/**
 * Turns a display name into the lowercase, hyphenated form that appears in a
 * URL.
 *
 * <p>Azerbaijani is the primary language, so the folding is written for it
 * rather than inherited from a library that assumes Latin-1. {@code ə} has no
 * decomposition — Unicode normalisation leaves it untouched — so a name like
 * "Səbinə" would otherwise slug to something containing a character that half
 * the systems downstream will percent-encode and the other half will mangle.
 * The same applies to {@code ı}, whose uppercase is {@code I} and whose
 * lowercase in a Turkish locale is not what a default {@code toLowerCase} would
 * produce; every case conversion here is explicitly {@link Locale#ROOT}.
 *
 * <p>The folding matches {@code docs/architecture.md} §11.3, which asks the
 * search index to fold the same characters. A slug and a search term that
 * disagree about what "Sabina" folds to would be two answers to one question.
 * {@link #fold} is that one answer: {@code Tag.slugOf} and the search index both
 * go through it, and the database's {@code ideanest_fold} is its mirror.

     *
     * <p><strong>This is the platform's one definition of the fold, and it has a
     * mirror in the database.</strong> {@code ideanest_fold(text)} — V13 — does
     * exactly this, because the search index is built from the folded text and a
     * query folded only in Java would not match an index folded differently. The
     * two are pinned to each other over a shared table of cases by
     * {@code SearchFoldingTests}; if this method changes and that function does
     * not, that suite fails rather than the search quietly returning nothing.
     *
     * <p>The fold runs <strong>before</strong> the lower-casing and covers both
     * cases of each letter, because {@code "İ".toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT)} produces
     * an {@code i} followed by a combining dot above rather than a plain
     * {@code i} — a difference invisible in a diff and fatal to a unique index,
     * and one PostgreSQL's {@code lower()} makes differently again depending on
     * the database's ctype. Mapping {@code İ} straight to {@code i} makes the
     * answer the same in both languages.
     *
     * <p>No transliteration beyond those seven pairs, and no normalisation: this
     * is the comparison form of a word, not a slug. {@link #slugify} adds NFKD and
     * the hyphenation on top.
     *
     * @param text any text; null folds to an empty string, because a caller
     *     comparing "nothing" against a stored value wants no match rather than a
     *     null check at every site
