/**
 * Who a creator legally is — issue #430, as it crosses a module boundary.
 *
 * <p><strong>A fact about the account, not a record of a check.</strong> That distinction is
 * the whole of #430. {@code identity_verifications.subject_kind} says what a reviewer was
 * looking at when they looked; this says what the platform is dealing with, and a creator
 * who has never been asked to verify anything still has one of these while having no
 * verification row at all.
 *
 * <p>The payout needs it to apply withholding, the agreement needs it to bind the right
 * party, #429's signature needs {@link #legalName()} to match a certificate subject against,
 * and #432 needs the same name to match a bank account holder against. None of those may
 * read {@code creator_legal_subjects}, so this is what they read instead.
 *
 * <h2>Why the entity fields are optional rather than a second type</h2>
 *
 * <p>An {@code INDIVIDUAL} has a name and nothing else; a {@code LEGAL_ENTITY} has a VÖEN, a
 * registered address and a registration number as well. Two records — one per subject kind —
 * would model that more precisely and would make every caller switch on the kind before it
 * could ask for a name, which is the one field they all want and the one field both kinds
 * have. So it is one record with optional halves, and {@link #isComplete()} is what a gate
 * asks rather than each gate re-deriving which fields its subject kind requires.
 *
 * <h2>What is not here</h2>
 *
 * <p>No verification state. Whether the platform has <em>checked</em> any of this is
 * {@link CreatorStanding}'s question and is answered from a different table by a different
 * module, because the two facts move independently: a creator corrects a misspelled legal
 * name without that being a new identity check, and an approval ages out without the name
 * changing.
 *
 * <p>No bank details. #432's destination is a token held by the provider, for
 * {@code PayoutRequest}'s stated reason, and a record that carried an IBAN beside a VÖEN
 * would be the second class of sensitive data that reasoning exists to avoid.
 *
 * @param subjectKind an individual or a registered entity, in V58's vocabulary
 * @param legalName the name that must agree with #429's certificate subject and #432's
 *     account holder. Present for both kinds
 * @param taxId the VÖEN, for a legal entity. Shape-validated and nothing more — see
 *     {@code TaxIdentifier}
 * @param registeredAddress the address on the registration extract, for a legal entity
 * @param registrationNumber the entity's registration number, for a legal entity
