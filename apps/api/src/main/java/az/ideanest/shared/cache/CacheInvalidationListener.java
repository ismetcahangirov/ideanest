/**
 * Which published events make a cached public page wrong — issue #127.
 *
 * <h2>It reads one field by name, and does not import a single event class</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every event below belongs to a different module, and a cross-cutting concern that
 * imported {@code PledgeConfirmed}, {@code CommentPostedEvent} and four of {@code ProjectEvents}
 * would be a package with a dependency on half the service — which {@code ModuleBoundaryTests}
 * refuses, and rightly: nothing about invalidating a cache needs to know what a pledge is.
 *
 * <p>So this reads the payload as a tree and takes {@code projectId} if it is there, falling
 * back to the aggregate identifier when the aggregate <em>is</em> the campaign. That is
 * deliberately stringly-typed, and the reason it is acceptable is the same reason the whole
 * feature is a hint rather than a guarantee: a field that is renamed stops producing an
 * invalidation, and the far side's sixty-second window is what the page falls back to. The
 * failure mode is a page that is briefly stale, not a page that is wrong and a service that
 * crashed telling somebody about it.
 *
 * <h2>Which events, and why not the others</h2>
 *
 * <p>A campaign's public page is a statement about how much has been raised, by how many
 * people, and what its team has said. So: money arriving ({@code pledge.confirmed},
 * {@code pledge.collected}), the team speaking ({@code project.update_published}), the audience
 * speaking ({@code comment.posted}), and the campaign's own state changing.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code project.approved} is not here</strong>, because approval is not
 * publication — §6.1 gives a campaign a separate {@code launched} transition, and a page that
 * does not exist yet has no cache entry to drop.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code pledge.edited} and the payment failures are not here either.</strong> A
 * pledge that changed or failed alters a total the public page shows, so on paper they qualify;
 * in practice they are the events most likely to arrive in bursts, and each one would evict a
 * campaign page for a change of a few manat in a figure rounded to the nearest whole one on
 * screen. The window covers them. The two that are here are the ones a backer watches for:
 * their own pledge appearing, and their own money moving.
 *
 * <h2>The feed is invalidated by membership, never by ordering</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link CacheTags#DISCOVERY} goes with the three events that change which campaigns are in
 * the feed at all — a launch, and the two ways a campaign ends. Not with a pledge, which
 * changes only where a campaign sits in it: see {@link CacheTags#forCampaign} for what evicting
 * the feed on every pledge would cost.
