/**
 * §21.1's four languages, and the one place a stored tag becomes a {@link Locale} — issue #324.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why this is in {@code shared} rather than beside the thing that needed it.</strong>
 * Three modules already spell this list: {@code Taxonomy} resolves category names against it,
 * {@code users_locale_supported} in {@code V2__create_identity_schema.sql} constrains the column,
 * and the web client keeps a third copy that {@code locale.test.ts} asserts. The notification
 * module needs it too now, to send in the recipient's language, and it may not reach into
 * {@code project} to get it — {@code ModuleBoundaryTests} is explicit that a fact belonging to no
 * one feature belongs here. {@code Taxonomy} reads this rather than repeating it, so the
 * fourth spelling is a delegation instead of a copy.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why a {@link Locale} at all.</strong> {@code users.locale} is a BCP 47 primary
 * subtag — {@code az}, not {@code az-Latn-AZ} — and everything that consumes it wants a
 * {@code Locale}: {@code MessageSource} selects a bundle with one, Thymeleaf takes one on its
 * context, and {@code MessageFormat} formats numbers and dates against one. Building it at each
 * call site is how a null column becomes {@code Locale.forLanguageTag(null)} and throws four
 * frames from the thing that stored it.
 *
 * <p><strong>An unknown tag falls back rather than throwing.</strong> A value that is not one of
 * the four can only come from a row written before a constraint, or by hand; the honest answer is
 * an email in the primary language rather than an email that is not sent at all. That is the same
 * decision {@code localeOrDefault} makes in the web client, and the same one {@code Taxonomy}
 * makes about a requested language it has no rows for.
