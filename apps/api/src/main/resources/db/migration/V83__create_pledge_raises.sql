-- #171: raising a paid pledge while its campaign is taking pledges, and charging the difference.
--
-- Since IDN-EXT-01 (#39) a pledge is charged when it is made and is COLLECTED from then on, so
-- §4.5's PL-09 edit -- which only moves DRAFT and CONFIRMED pledges -- no longer reaches the pledge
-- almost every backer holds. A raise is PL-09 for a paid pledge: a new selection, re-quoted, that
-- must cost more than the old one, with the difference charged on the provider's page exactly as
-- the confirmation charge is. The pledge changes only once the provider says the difference was
-- paid, so the raise has to be written down somewhere between the two requests. That is this table.
--
-- One row per attempt, never updated into a different attempt:
--
--   PENDING    the page was opened; the places the new selection needs are held as RESERVED
--   SUCCEEDED  paid for and applied: the pledge carries the new selection and total
--   FAILED     the provider said the payment failed; nothing changed, the held places went back
--   EXPIRED    nobody paid within the payment window; the held places went back. Not final: a
--              payment that arrives later is still applied if nothing has changed since
--   ABANDONED  the page could not be opened at all; nothing was charged
--   UNAPPLIED  the provider took the money and the raise could no longer be applied -- the pledge
--              was refunded, changed by a later raise, or the places are gone. The charge is owed
--              back, and the campaign-refunds job returns it (RAISE_NOT_APPLIED, below)
--
-- Reverse: ALTER TABLE refunds DROP COLUMN review_reason; DROP TABLE pledge_raise_lines; DROP TABLE
-- pledge_raises; and restore the two refund constraints below without RAISE_NOT_APPLIED -- once no
-- row uses it.
--
-- Contract: none. Two new tables, a nullable column on refunds that the previous release does not map,
-- and two CHECK constraints that accept one more value; nothing the previous release reads or writes
-- goes away, so the SCHEMA is safe under a rolling deployment. (A previous-release node reconciling a
-- refund marked for review would fail refunds_review_only_while_requested and roll back -- which is
-- the point of the mark.)
--
-- The BEHAVIOUR is not, for the minutes both releases run, and what covers it is code rather than
-- this file:
--   * A previous-release node that receives the success webhook of a raise's charge records the
--     SUCCEEDED charge and its ledger posting, does not know the charge pays for a raise, and leaves
--     the raise PENDING (and then EXPIRED once the reservation cleaner reaches it). Nothing in that
--     release would ever apply or refund it. The reservation cleaner of this release sweeps every
--     SUCCEEDED `pledge-raise-*` charge whose raise is not SUCCEEDED or UNAPPLIED and settles it as
--     the webhook would have: applied while it still can be, otherwise UNAPPLIED and refunded.
--   * A previous-release node's campaign-refunds job refunds a pledge as one refund against its
--     newest charge. On a raised pledge that asks for more than that payment was, which a provider
--     refuses (a payment is reversed up to its own amount); the refusal is recorded FAILED, and this
--     release's job refunds each charge for what it has left -- the refused one once `retry-after`
--     has passed.
--   * A previous-release node has no POST /v1/pledges/{id}/raise, so a raise routed to one is a 404
--     and nothing is held or charged.
--
-- The two constraint swaps at the end are a DROP and an ADD each, and the ADD validates at once.
-- NOT VALID plus VALIDATE would buy nothing here: DROP CONSTRAINT already holds ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on
-- `refunds` until this migration's transaction commits, so a VALIDATE in the same transaction scans
-- under the same lock, and V46 records why this directory does not leave constraints unvalidated.
