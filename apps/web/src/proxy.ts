/**
 * Where a request with no language in its path is sent — issue #123.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not just `createIntlMiddleware`</h2>
 *
 * next-intl's middleware can pick a language on its own, and `routing.ts` turns that off.
 * Its detection reads `Accept-Language`, which makes the response vary by that header, and
 * a `Vary: Accept-Language` on the front door fragments the shared CDN cache per browser
 * configuration. The whole reason the language moved into the path was to stop paying a
 * per-visitor cost on cached routes; negotiating on a header would put it back.
 *
 * So this file answers the one question detection existed to answer — *a request arrived
 * at `/discover` with no language, which language did this person mean?* — from the stored
 * preference alone, and delegates everything else.
 *
 * <h2>The cookie's job changed, and shrank</h2>
 *
 * It used to be what a render read to know what language to draw. It is not that any more:
 * the path says the language, and a render that needed the cookie would be dynamic again.
 * All the cookie does now is answer the redirect above — *last time, this person chose
 * Russian* — so a returning reader who types the bare domain is not met by English.
 *
 * `users.locale` remains the durable record and this remains its cache. `SessionProvider`
 * still mirrors the account's column into it on bootstrap, so the preference survives a new
 * device; that mechanism is untouched.
 *
 * <h2>It is also where a public page is marked cacheable — #127</h2>
 *
 * Every server render in this application is anonymous: the refresh cookie lives on
 * `Path=/v1/auth`, so a page request carries no session, and nothing under `src/` reads
 * `next/headers` at all. That makes the HTML of a public page shareable, which the framework
 * cannot infer — a dynamic route is `private, no-store` by default, whatever it rendered.
 *
 * `lib/cache/publicRoutes.ts` decides which paths qualify and why the decision is a function
 * rather than a pattern in `next.config.mjs`. It is applied here because this is the one place
 * every request already passes through, and because a header set beside the redirect that
 * created the address cannot drift away from it.
 *
 * <h2>307 AND NOT 308, DELIBERATELY</h2>
 *
 * The destination depends on a cookie, so it is not permanent and must never be recorded as
 * such. A browser that cached a 308 from `/` to `/en` would keep sending itself to English
 * after the reader chose Azerbaijani — from its own cache, without asking, in a way that
 * clearing the site's cookies does not fix and that no server-side change can reach.

   * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT MATCHED, EACH FOR ITS OWN REASON.
   *
   * `api/` is the RUM beacon. It is called by `WebVitals` from every page including the
   * localised ones, and a redirect on a `sendBeacon` is a measurement silently lost.
   *
   * `v1/` is the service. `next.config.mjs` rewrites it to the API origin, and the proxy
   * runs before that rewrite — so a match here does not delay the call, it replaces it. While
   * this prefix was missing, every request the browser made to the API was answered with a
   * `307` to `/en/v1/...`, which matches no route and no rewrite. `fetch` follows the
   * redirect, is handed a 404 page, and the form reports that the service could not be
   * reached: a network failure with a healthy service behind it. Sign-in and register were
   * both unusable in the browser while both worked when called directly.
   *
   * `_next/` and anything with a dot in the last segment are build output and static files.
   * Prefixing a hashed chunk with a language would 404 it.
   *
   * `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` and `sitemap_index.xml` are addresses fixed by convention
   * rather than by this application, and a crawler that follows a redirect to `/en/robots.txt`
   * has been given a file at an address it will not treat as authoritative. They stay at the
   * root and enumerate the localised pages from there.
   *
   * `.well-known/` is the same rule with sharper consequences — issue #114. It carries the
   * two files that let a link on this site open the mobile application, and one of them,
   * `apple-app-site-association`, has NO EXTENSION: the `.*\.[\w]+$` clause above is what
   * spares every other fixed address, and it is precisely what does not spare this one.
   * Apple's fetcher does not follow a redirect, so a `307` to `/en/.well-known/...` reads to
   * it as "this site has no association" — universal links then never activate, silently,
   * with nothing broken on the site itself to notice. The whole prefix is excluded rather
   * than that one file, because every address under it is fixed by a specification rather
   * than by this application and none of them may be localised.
