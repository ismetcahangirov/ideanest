/**
 * Appearance is reviewed in Storybook. These cover what fails silently: the
 * validation boundaries of docs/architecture.md §5.3, a goal amount that must
 * never become a float, a refusal that has to stay recoverable, and an
 * accessible name on every control.
 *
 * Autosave's own semantics — the debounce, the single request in flight, the
 * merge-back on failure — are pinned down in `useAutosave.test.tsx`, where the
 * timers can be driven exactly. Here the assertions are about WHAT was sent
 * rather than how many requests it took, so a slow machine cannot turn a passing
 * test red by letting a debounce elapse one keystroke early.
 *
 * `measureImage` is mocked because jsdom never loads an image: an `<img>` there
 * fires neither `load` nor `error`, so the real implementation would hang. What
 * the mock returns is what a browser would have reported.
 *
 * `uploadImage` is mocked for the same class of reason: it makes three network calls and
 * polls a fourth. What is asserted here is what the panel does with the answer -- the
 * upload itself belongs to the API, and the conversion behind it is asserted against a
 * real libvips in the backend suite.
