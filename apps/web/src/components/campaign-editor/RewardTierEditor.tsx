/**
 * One reward tier: what a backer selects and pays for.
 *
 * <h3>WHY THIS DOES NOT AUTOSAVE</h3>
 *
 * The basics and story tabs write every keystroke through `useAutosave`, and
 * this tab does not. The service's own contract assumes it will —
 * `RewardPatchRequest` says "the rewards tab autosaves one input at a time" —
 * and merge-patch is exactly what makes an explicit save cheap here too: only
 * the fields that changed are sent, so the contract is honoured either way.
 * What differs is what a half-typed value MEANS.
 *
 *   A half-typed title is a title that is briefly wrong. A half-typed PRICE is
 *   a different, valid, chargeable price. Somebody typing 19.99 passes through
 *   1, 19, 19.9 — and each of those is a figure the service accepts, stores,
 *   and would quote to a backer looking at the page in that second.
 *
 *   A half-typed LIMIT is worse. Typing 100 over 5 passes through 1, and §5.3
 *   refuses a limit below what is already claimed — so an edit that is
 *   perfectly legal at the end of the word is refused in the middle of it, and
 *   autosave retries the same rejected body until the creator gives up.
 *
 *   And creating a tier is a `POST`. It cannot be debounced into existence
 *   without creating one tier per pause in typing.
 *
 * So the drawer commits on Save. Nothing is forked to do it: the failure is
 * described by `useAutosave`'s own `describeFailure`, and the field messages
 * land through the same `fieldErrorsFrom` the item editor uses. What is not
 * reused is the debounce, and that is the whole of the difference.
 *
 * <h3>TWO REQUESTS, DELIBERATELY</h3>
 *
 * The rate table is replaced through its own `PUT` (see `replaceShippingRules`)
 * because a rate table is read as a whole by whatever quotes from it. So a save
 * that changes both the tier and its rates is two requests, in that order — the
 * `PUT` is refused on a tier that is not shipped, so the scope has to have been
 * changed first. When the second one fails the first has already succeeded, and
 * this says exactly that rather than reporting a failure that would leave the
 * creator retyping a tier that is already saved.
 *
 * <h3>WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE</h3>
 *
 * <strong>Images on a tier.</strong> §4.6 lists them. `reward_tiers` has no
 * image column and `RewardResponse` carries none, so there is nowhere to put
 * one; a tier's pictures are the pictures of the items it contains, which do
 * have an `imageUrl`. Inventing a column here would be a field that forgets
 * what it was told.
 *
 * <strong>A country picker.</strong> A destination is typed as its two-letter
 * code, which is what the service stores and re-checks. Nothing in the
 * repository holds a list of countries with their names, and a hard-coded one
 * in a drawer is a list that goes stale where nobody is looking.
