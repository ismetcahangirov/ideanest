/**
 * The creator's pre-launch tab.
 *
 * The test that carries the design is
 * {@link openingIsBehindAConfirmation}: opening the page publishes the campaign
 * and docs/architecture.md §6.1 has no edge back, so a control that did it on a
 * single click would be the worst control on the platform. The rest cover the
 * two things a creator comes to this tab for — the link and the number — and the
 * fact that the content editor writes through the ordinary autosave path rather
 * than inventing a second one.
 *
 * `navigator.clipboard` is stubbed because jsdom has none; what the stub records
 * is what the browser would have been handed.
