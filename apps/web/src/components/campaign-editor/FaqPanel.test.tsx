/**
 * §4.4's creator-managed question and answer list — the editor half of #283.
 *
 * Appearance is reviewed in Storybook. These cover what fails silently:
 *
 *   - **reordering is reachable without a pointer, and it sends every identifier exactly
 *     once.** Dragging alone is unreachable by keyboard, by switch control and on every touch
 *     device — the rule docs/ui-kit.md §7.13 states about the drop zone's button — and the
 *     service refuses a partial order outright, because the entries it omitted would stay
 *     where they were and interleave with the ones that moved.
 *   - **the move is announced with its new position.** A creator who cannot see the list is
 *     told nothing at all by a visual reshuffle.
 *   - **focus lands on the control the entry keeps.** An entry moved to an end loses one of
 *     its two buttons, and a control that disables itself under the user's finger drops focus
 *     at the top of the document.
 *   - **a refusal naming missing and unexpected identifiers reaches the creator as
 *     questions.** `FAQ_ORDER_INCOMPLETE` carries UUIDs in `meta`, and a UUID is not something
 *     anybody can act on; the list is also re-read, because the optimistic order on screen is
 *     a lie once the service has refused it.
 *   - **every control says which entry it acts on.** "Delete" six times over is six controls a
 *     screen-reader user cannot tell apart (docs/ui-kit.md §9.1).
 *   - **nothing is saved on a pause in typing.** Creating an entry is a `POST` and a `POST`
 *     cannot be debounced — and this list is public the moment the campaign is, so a
 *     half-typed question is one a backer reads.
