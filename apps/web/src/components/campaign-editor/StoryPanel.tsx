/**
 * The story tab: the document, the mandatory risks section, the anchor navigation
 * the headings generate, and the version history.
 *
 * There is no save button. The document and the risks each autosave through
 * `PATCH /v1/projects/{id}` on a debounce (`useAutosave`), and the indicator in the
 * header is the only thing that reports on it.
 *
 * <h3>THE DOCUMENT IS ONLY SENT WHEN IT IS VALID</h3>
 *
 * A document with an image whose description has not been written yet is a document
 * the server refuses (`STORY_DOCUMENT_INVALID`), so sending it would put the editor
 * into a permanent failure state while the creator finishes typing — and, worse,
 * would stop every later save from going out, because autosave keeps one request in
 * flight and retries the same body. So an invalid document is held: the block says
 * what is wrong, the header says the story is not saved, and the moment it becomes
 * valid the whole document goes.
 *
 * That is the same rule the basics tab applies to a field it cannot parse. It is
 * safe because nothing is discarded — the draft is in the component and the last
 * document the server accepted is still on the server.
 *
 * <h3>WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE</h3>
 *
 * <strong>The FAQ editor.</strong> §4.6 lists it in this tab. It needs a `faqs`
 * table with a question, an answer, and an order, and no migration in this epic
 * creates one — the epic contract §2 assigns V8 to story versions and nothing to
 * FAQs. Building it against `projects.story` would mean smuggling a second document
 * into a column whose schema #37 and the public page both read, so it is left out
 * rather than invented.
 *
 * <strong>Uploading.</strong> There is no media table and no uploader (contract §3).
 * An image block takes a published address and the dimensions read from it in the
 * browser, and the interface says so.
 *
 * MOTION: none, beyond the save indicator and the overlays' own entry
 * (docs/motion-system.md §5). Creators spend hours in here.
