/**
 * Appearance is reviewed in Storybook. The document model's own rules are pinned

 * cover what only exists once the pieces are assembled, and what would fail
 * silently.
 *
 * Two of them carry the design. An image block with no description must be HELD
 * rather than sent — the server refuses that document, and autosave retries the
 * same body, so one unfinished description would stop every later save in the
 * session. And every add, move, and remove control must carry a name that says
 * WHICH block it acts on: eleven buttons all called "Move up" are eleven
 * indistinguishable buttons to anybody not looking at the screen.
