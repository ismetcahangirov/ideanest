/**
 * Whether the work is safe. The only moving thing in the campaign editor.
 *
 * The motion budget for this surface is "none — autosave indicator only"
 * (docs/motion-system.md §5), and this is that indicator: one rotating glyph,
 * transform only, dropped entirely under `prefers-reduced-motion` through
 * `motion-safe`. Creators spend hours here and anything else that moved would
 * be in the way.
 *
 * "Saved" is `--success`, never lime. Lime means *urgent*, "act now"
 * (docs/ui-kit.md §2.4), and a saved draft is the opposite of that.
 *
 * COLOUR IS NOT THE STATE. Each state is a word with an icon beside it, so the
 * difference between saved and not saved does not depend on telling green from
 * red (§9.2).
 *
 * ONLY THE OUTCOMES ARE ANNOUNCED. The live region carries "Saved" and "Not
 * saved" but not "Saving" — a screen-reader user gains nothing from being told
 * a request is in progress, and being told it after every pause in typing is
 * noise that drowns the message that matters.
