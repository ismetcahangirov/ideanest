/*
 * The disabled-tab half of `available`, pinned against a fabricated tab list.
 *
 * IT LIVES IN ITS OWN FILE BECAUSE IT MOCKS `./tabs`, and `vi.mock` is per
 * module graph: the sibling suite asserts the navigation against the real
 * EDITOR_TABS and must keep seeing the real one.
 *
 * The list is fabricated rather than borrowed because there is no longer an
 * unbuilt section to borrow. Every row in EDITOR_TABS shipped with this epic
 * (#33, #34, #35, #37, #39), and the previous version of this test named
 * whichever section happened to be next — it was rewritten three times as the
 * epic landed, each time for a reason that had nothing to do with the behaviour
 * it was named for. §4.6 still describes people, account, and promotion, so the
 * mechanism has users ahead of it; this is what stops it rotting before they
 * arrive.
