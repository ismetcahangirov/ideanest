/**
 * One question and the creator's answer to it.
 *
 * <h3>IT SAVES WHEN THE CREATOR SAYS SO</h3>
 *
 * The basics and story tabs autosave and this deliberately does not, for the
 * half of `RewardsPanel`'s argument that applies here on its own: creating an
 * entry is a `POST`, and a `POST` cannot be debounced. A form that fired one on
 * a pause in typing would publish a question called "Do" and five more as the
 * sentence was finished, each of them a row a creator then has to delete — from
 * a list that is <em>public the moment the campaign is</em>.
 *
 * That last part is why this is not merely inconvenient. A half-typed reward
 * tier sits in a draft; a half-typed FAQ entry on a live campaign is a question
 * a backer reads.
 *
 * <h3>NOTHING IS FORKED TO DO IT</h3>
 *
 * `describeFailure` turns a refusal into a sentence exactly as it does for an
 * autosave, and the field messages land through the same `fieldErrorsFrom` the
 * two reward editors use — so a refusal reads the same wherever in the editor it
 * happened. Only the debounce is absent.
 *
 * <h3>MOTION</h3>
 *
 * The drawer's own 200ms entry, transform only, collapsed entirely under
 * `prefers-reduced-motion`. Nothing here adds any: docs/motion-system.md §5
 * gives the campaign editor "none — autosave indicator only".
