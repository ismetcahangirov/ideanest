/**
 * The FAQ tab of the campaign editor — §4.4's "creator-managed question and
 * answer list", the half of #283 that puts content on the public tab.
 *
 * <h3>WITHOUT THIS THE PUBLIC TAB IS PERMANENTLY EMPTY</h3>
 *
 * The reader half of #283 is a tab that renders whatever the service holds.
 * Nothing on the platform could put anything there, so shipping the tab alone
 * would have replaced one permanent empty state ("no endpoint") with another
 * ("no way to write"). The tab and the panel are one change.
 *
 * <h3>REORDERING IS BUTTONS, NOT DRAGGING</h3>
 *
 * The same rule and the same reason as `RewardsPanel`, and the same rule
 * docs/ui-kit.md §7.13 states about the drop zone's button: dragging alone is
 * unreachable by keyboard, by switch control, and on every touch device, and
 * CLAUDE.md makes an accessibility failure a build error rather than a nicety.
 * So the order is changed by a pair of controls per entry, each with a name that
 * says which entry it moves and where it is, and each move is announced through
 * a polite live region with the new position in it — a creator who cannot see
 * the list has to be told the move happened, because a visual reshuffle tells
 * them nothing.
 *
 * Focus is handed on deliberately: an entry moved to the top has no "move up"
 * left, so focus lands on its "move down" rather than being dropped at the top
 * of the document by a button that disabled itself under the creator's finger.
 *
 * Pointer dragging is a layer that could be added ON TOP of this later. It is
 * not a replacement for it.
 *
 * <h3>THE ORDER IS SENT WHOLE</h3>
 *
 * `PATCH /v1/projects/{id}/faqs/reorder` takes every identifier exactly once or
 * refuses with `FAQ_ORDER_INCOMPLETE` and a `meta` naming what was missing and
 * what was unexpected. That refusal is rendered rather than swallowed, and it is
 * rendered as sentences about questions rather than as identifiers: a creator
 * cannot act on a UUID, and the refusal only ever happens when this page's list
 * has fallen behind the service's — an entry added or deleted in another tab.
 *
 * <h3>MOTION: NONE</h3>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 gives the campaign editor "none — autosave indicator
 * only". The drawer brings its own 200ms entry, which honours
 * `prefers-reduced-motion`; nothing here adds any. In particular the list does
 * not animate as it reorders — a creator pressing "move up" four times would be
 * watching an animation rather than a list.
