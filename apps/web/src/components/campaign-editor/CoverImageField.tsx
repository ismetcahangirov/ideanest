/**
 * The cover image.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY BOTH HALVES HAD TO. This form used to say, in a banner, that it
 * could not store a file — there was no uploader, no object storage and no `media` table
 * (docs/architecture.md §13.1). It also refused any image below 1024×576. Together those
 * meant a creator holding an 800×600 photograph was stopped at the first screen of the
 * editor and told to go and publish a larger one somewhere else first.
 *
 * Both are gone. Dropping a file uploads it: the browser writes to a presigned address, the
 * service strips the metadata, reduces it to 1440px and measures it, and what comes back is
 * the cover — with §13.1's blur placeholder, from the server rather than from this component's
 * own sample. And the minimum is advice: a smaller image is saved and says so.
 *
 * THE ADDRESS FIELD STAYS. Every campaign that predates the uploader has a typed URL, and
 * pasting one still works. It is the path where nothing on the server has seen the image, so
 * the dimensions are read here in the browser and are the client's word — which is one of the
 * two reasons the size rule stopped blocking.

              NOT `next/image`, AND THAT IS THE POINT. A preview has to show the

              their own photograph by our AVIF of it. The file is also already in

              optimiser would add a request rather than remove one, on the surface
              docs/motion-system.md §5 gives the tightest budget in the product.

              preview of an image the creator has this second chosen has no
