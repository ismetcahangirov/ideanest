/**
 * One item: the atomic thing a campaign produces, which tiers are composed
 * from.
 *
 * <h3>IT SAVES WHEN THE CREATOR SAYS SO</h3>
 *
 * The basics and story tabs autosave, and this deliberately does not. The full
 * reasoning is on `RewardsPanel`; one half of it applies here on its own.
 * Creating an item is a `POST`, and a `POST` cannot be debounced — a form that
 * fired one on a pause in typing would create an item called "H" and five more
 * as the word was finished, each of them a row a creator then has to delete.
 *
 * Everything else is reused rather than reinvented. `describeFailure` turns a
 * refusal into a sentence exactly as it does for an autosave, and the field
 * messages land through the same `fieldErrorsFrom` both editors use, so a
 * refusal reads the same wherever in the editor it happened.
