/**
 * The pre-launch tab: what the pre-launch page will say, the link to share, how
 * many people are waiting, and the control that makes it public.
 *
 * THE CONTENT IS THE BASICS, ON PURPOSE. There is no separate pre-launch
 * headline or pre-launch summary. A dedicated pair would let a creator promise
 * one thing on the page people follow and a different thing on the campaign it
 * becomes, and the follower signed up for the first. So this edits `title`,
 * `blurb`, and `coverImage` through the same `PATCH /v1/projects/{id}` autosave
 * the Basics tab uses — the same fields, shown here in the arrangement the
 * public page renders them in, so a creator can see what they are publishing
 * rather than imagining it.
 *
 * OPENING THE PAGE IS NOT AN AUTOSAVE. It publishes the campaign's title,
 * summary, and cover to anybody with the link, and docs/architecture.md §6.1 has
 * no edge back — there is no PRELAUNCH → DRAFT. A switch that did that silently
 * on the way past would be the worst control on the platform, so it is a button,
 * behind a dialog that says what cannot be undone.
 *
 * MOTION: none beyond the save indicator (docs/motion-system.md §5, "campaign
 * editor — none"). The modal's own entry is the overlay pattern of §4.11 and
 * belongs to the component, not to this surface's budget.
