/**
 * The rewards tab: the campaign's items, and the tiers composed from them.
 *
 * <h3>ITEMS FIRST, THEN TIERS</h3>
 *
 * The order §4.6 puts them in, and the order the endpoints are shaped for: a
 * tier is a selection of items with quantities, so there is nothing to compose
 * until the items exist.
 *
 * <h3>THERE IS NO AUTOSAVE ON THIS TAB</h3>
 *
 * Every other tab in this editor writes on a debounce. This one commits when
 * the creator presses Save, and the reasoning is set out in full on
 * `RewardTierEditor`: a half-typed price is a different valid price, a
 * half-typed quantity limit is refused by §5.3, and creating a tier is a `POST`
 * that cannot be debounced into existence. Nothing was forked to do it —
 * `describeFailure` and the failure shape are `useAutosave`'s, and only the
 * debounce is absent.
 *
 * The actions that are NOT a form — reorder, duplicate, hide, delete — commit
 * on the click, because a click is already an explicit instruction and there is
 * nothing to debounce.
 *
 * <h3>REORDERING IS BUTTONS, NOT DRAGGING</h3>
 *
 * §4.6 says drag-to-reorder. Dragging alone is unreachable by keyboard, by
 * switch control, and on every touch device, and CLAUDE.md makes an
 * accessibility failure a build error rather than a nicety — so the order is
 * changed by a pair of controls per tier, each with a name that says which tier
 * it moves, and each move is announced through a polite live region with the
 * new position in it. A creator who cannot see the list has to be told the move
 * happened; a visual reshuffle tells them nothing.
 *
 * Focus is handed on deliberately: a tier moved to the top has no "move up"
 * left, so focus lands on its "move down" instead of being dropped at the top
 * of the document.
 *
 * Pointer dragging is a layer that could be added ON TOP of this later. It is
 * not a replacement for it, and it is not in this change.
 *
 * <h3>MOTION: NONE</h3>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 gives the campaign editor "none — autosave
 * indicator only". The drawers bring their own 200ms entry, which honours
 * `prefers-reduced-motion`; nothing on this page adds any. In particular the
 * list does not animate as it reorders: a creator pressing "move up" four times
 * would be watching an animation rather than a list.
