/**
 * §22.3's "clear fee disclosure" — issue #439.
 *
 * <h2>What this fixes</h2>
 *
 * Until this component the platform's fee copy was a sentence in a message catalogue saying that
 * every payment is priced at zero commission. It was *true*, because no schedule is seeded — and
 * it would have become **false the day one was**, silently, because nothing checks a catalogue
 * against a table. Everything here is derived from `fee_schedules`, so the page cannot say a
 * number the platform is not charging.
 *
 * <h2>The two fees stay two numbers</h2>
 *
 * §5.2's platform fee and the payment provider's processing fee are drawn separately and are
 * never summed for the reader. #439 says exactly why: "a creator reading '5%' and receiving 94.2%
 * will ask, and the answer needs to already be on the page." A single combined rate is the
 * version of this component that produces that question.
 *
 * <h2>Two audiences, one source</h2>
 *
 * {@link FeeDisclosureProps.audience} decides the sentences and nothing else. A backer is told
 * what their pledge is subject to; a creator is told what they will actually receive. Both read
 * the same schedule, so the two pages cannot come to different answers about the same terms —
 * which is the failure two separately-written fee sections eventually produce.
 *
 * <h2>Arithmetic through `decimal.js`, never through a number</h2>
 *
 * CLAUDE.md, and it is not ceremony here: turning `"0.05000"` into a percentage means
 * multiplying by a hundred, and `0.05 * 100` is `5.000000000000001` in IEEE 754. The rate
 * arrives as a string, is multiplied as a decimal, and reaches `Intl.NumberFormat` as a value
 * that has already been rounded to the two places the screen shows.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing configured is said out loud</h2>
 *
 * Not zeros, and not silence. `configured: false` means the platform has not set a schedule, and
 * the page says so — a reader who is told "no fee is currently charged" has been told something
 * true and revocable, where "0%" reads as a commitment. Silence would be worse than either: a
 * pledge screen with no fee section at all is one where the reader has to assume.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none, and this is where the rule bites hardest</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5: motion decreases as money gets closer, and checkout must not
 * animate. This component appears on the checkout screen. Every animation there reads as
 * hesitation, and hesitation about the fee is the worst place on the platform to put it.
