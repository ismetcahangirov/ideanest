/**
 * §22.3's "clear fee disclosure" — issue #439.
 *
 * <h2>What this fixes</h2>
 *
 * Until this component the platform's fee copy was a sentence in a message catalogue saying that
 * every payment is priced at zero commission. It was *true*, because no schedule is seeded — and
 * it would have become **false the day one was**, silently, because nothing checks a catalogue
 * against a table. Everything here is derived from `fee_schedules`, so the page cannot say a
 * number the platform is not charging.
 *
 * <h2>The two fees stay two numbers</h2>
 *
 * §5.2's platform fee and the payment provider's processing fee are drawn separately and are
 * never summed for the reader. #439 says exactly why: "a creator reading '5%' and receiving 94.2%
 * will ask, and the answer needs to already be on the page." A single combined rate is the
 * version of this component that produces that question.
 *
 * <h2>Two audiences, one source</h2>
 *
 * {@link FeeDisclosureProps.audience} decides the sentences and nothing else. A backer is told
 * what their pledge is subject to; a creator is told what they will actually receive. Both read
 * the same schedule, so the two pages cannot come to different answers about the same terms —
 * which is the failure two separately-written fee sections eventually produce.
 *
 * <h2>Arithmetic through `decimal.js`, never through a number</h2>
 *
 * CLAUDE.md, and it is not ceremony here: turning `"0.05000"` into a percentage means
 * multiplying by a hundred, and `0.05 * 100` is `5.000000000000001` in IEEE 754. The rate
 * arrives as a string, is multiplied as a decimal, and reaches `Intl.NumberFormat` as a value
 * that has already been rounded to the two places the screen shows.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing configured is said out loud</h2>
 *
 * Not zeros, and not silence. `configured: false` means the platform has not set a schedule, and
 * the page says so — a reader who is told "no fee is currently charged" has been told something
 * true and revocable, where "0%" reads as a commitment. Silence would be worse than either: a
 * pledge screen with no fee section at all is one where the reader has to assume.
 *
 * <h2>A failed read is not "nothing configured" — issue #145</h2>
 *
 * The two used to share one branch and one sentence, "nothing is being deducted from pledges
 * today". That sentence is true only when the service answered `configured: false`. When the
 * read failed — the API slow or down, as on 2026-09-28 during the DNS move — the platform may
 * well be charging, and a creator deciding about their campaign's money was told it was not.
 * A failed read now has its own sentence, which names no figure, says in as many words that it
 * is not a statement that nothing is charged, and links to the Plans and pricing page where the
 * rates in force are published. A body that claims `configured: true` without its rates is drawn the same way: it
 * is a disclosure the page cannot read, not a platform that has decided to charge nothing.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none, and this is where the rule bites hardest</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5: motion decreases as money gets closer, and checkout must not
 * animate. This component appears on the checkout screen. Every animation there reads as
 * hesitation, and hesitation about the fee is the worst place on the platform to put it.
