/**
 * §4.4's FAQ tab — issue #283, over the public read the service now publishes.
 *
 * <h2>An open list, not an accordion, and that is the decision this file makes</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §4.9 describes how to build a disclosure properly — the icon rotates
 * 180° rather than swapping glyphs, and the panel animates `grid-template-rows: 0fr → 1fr`
 * rather than `height`, because a height animation causes layout shift. The right way is
 * known. It is not taken here, for four reasons, in the order they matter:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>Collapsed text is text a reader cannot find.</strong> A backer looking for
 *       "does this ship to Germany" reaches for the browser's own find-in-page. Behind a
 *       closed `<details>` that search matches nothing in several browsers, and the reader
 *       concludes the campaign never said. The whole point of putting the FAQ on the server
 *       rather than behind JavaScript is that the words are in the document; hiding them
 *       again by default gives most of that back.
 *   <li><strong>§8 forbids animation in long content, and an answer is long content.</strong>
 *       The project page's budget is Moderate — section headings, counters, the sticky call
 *       to action — and an entry animation on the campaign's own answers would be spending it
 *       on the one surface where somebody is reading rather than exploring.
 *   <li><strong>The list is bounded.</strong> §4.4 caps a campaign at fifty entries and this
 *       component receives all of them at once; there is no page to collapse away, and the
 *       real ones run to a handful. An accordion is a scanning aid for a list too long to
 *       read down, which this is not.
 *   <li><strong>It costs nothing.</strong> No state, no client boundary, no runtime. The
 *       whole tab is a heading and an ordered list.
 * </ol>
 *
 * The day a campaign's FAQ genuinely is too long to read down, the answer is §4.9's
 * disclosure built with `grid-template-rows` — <em>not</em> a `height` transition, and not
 * one that leaves the answers out of find-in-page without `hidden="until-found"`.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing here is a client boundary</h2>
 *
 * No state, no handler, no hook — the same shape as `CampaignUpdates`. The tab is a server
 * render of a `permitAll` read on the route #119 exists to keep in the initial HTML.
 *
 * <h2>The order is the creator's</h2>
 *
 * `sort_order` is what `PATCH /v1/projects/{id}/faqs/reorder` writes and what the editor's
 * move controls change. This component renders the array in the order it was handed and
 * never sorts it: a creator who put the shipping question first meant it to be first.
 *
 * An `<ol>` rather than a `<div>` of cards, because the order is content. A screen reader
 * saying "list, 6 items, item 3 of 6" is telling the reader something true about the
 * campaign; a stack of unrelated boxes is not.
 *
 * <h2>Answers are text, never markup</h2>
 *
 * The same rule `CampaignUpdates` applies to an update body, and it applies here with less
 * ceremony because there is no schema at all behind this field: an answer is a string a
 * creator typed, reaching this component from a public endpoint. `whitespace-pre-line` keeps
 * the paragraph breaks — the only structure plain text has — and
 * `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` would make the campaign page a cross-site scripting vector on
 * the origin that holds the session.
 *
 * <h2>Motion</h2>
 *
 * None. See the second reason above.
