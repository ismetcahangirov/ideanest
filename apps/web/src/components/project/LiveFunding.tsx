/**
 * The campaign's funding numbers, as the server rendered them, plus whatever has happened since.
 *
 * <h2>The one client component beneath the public campaign page, and what that costs</h2>
 *
 * That page's own comment says there is no `'use client'` anywhere beneath it, "because there is
 * nothing to load". This is still true of the *content*: every number below is in the initial
 * HTML, rendered from the server's read, and a reader with no JavaScript, a crawler and a link
 * unfurler all see the complete document. What hydration adds is arithmetic on top of it.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole justification for the island. A client component that *fetched*
 * these numbers would break #119; one that starts from them and adds to them does not.
 *
 * <h2>Deltas, never totals</h2>
 *
 * The socket carries "40.50 arrived since I last spoke", not "the campaign has raised 5,040.50" —
 * `ChannelWindow` argues why the server cannot say the second without reading another module's
 * table, and why the first is the better shape anyway. So the total here is the server's value
 * plus every delta received, which means a reader who missed a window is *behind* rather than
 * wrong, and a reload corrects them.
 *
 * <h2>`Decimal`, and the percentage recomputed rather than carried</h2>
 *
 * CLAUDE.md §3: money never touches floating point, and this is the one place on the platform
 * where an amount is accumulated repeatedly in a browser. The percentage is recomputed from the
 * new total with `completionOf` — the same function the server-side read uses — because a
 * percentage frozen at the server's value while the amount beside it moved would be two numbers
 * disagreeing on one page.
 *
 * <h2>What it may import, and why that is a rule rather than a preference</h2>
 *
 * <p>A client component pulls its whole import graph into the browser bundle. The two imports
 * that matter here both looked harmless and both cost tens of kilobytes on the platform's most
 * performance-sensitive route: {@code @ideanest/ui}'s barrel, whose lean half is
 * {@code @ideanest/ui/server} and which is the entry to use even from a client component; and
 * {@code lib/projects/publicPage}, which reasonably imports every reader the campaign page
 * needs. {@code lib/projects/completion} exists because of the second one.
 *
 * <p><strong>The backer count is deliberately not live.</strong> A window carries how many
 * pledges were confirmed, and a pledge is not always a new backer: somebody who raises their
 * pledge confirms again. Adding it would make the count drift upwards over a campaign's life
 * with no way to correct itself, which is worse than a count that is right at page load.
