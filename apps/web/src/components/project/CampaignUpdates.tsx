/**
 * §4.4's Updates tab — issue #284, over §4.9's public update read.
 *
 * <h2>Server-rendered, like the story above it</h2>
 *
 * `GET /v1/projects/{projectId}/updates` is `permitAll`, and what it returns is the campaign
 * speaking to the people who backed it. A tab that fetched it after hydration would put that
 * behind JavaScript on the route #119 exists to keep in the initial HTML — and "update 7 said
 * the moulds were late" is exactly the kind of sentence somebody finds by searching for a
 * phrase from it.
 *
 * Nothing here is a client boundary. The one exception is the publication date, which goes
 * through `ViewerInstant` for the reason `ViewerClock` gives at length: the server cannot
 * know the reader's time zone, and that island already exists on this page for the deadline.
 *
 * <h2>The number is the service's, and this component never counts</h2>
 *
 * §4.9: the number is allocated once, at insert, behind a lock on the newest row, and never
 * recomputed — because "update 7" is a thing somebody says to support six months later.
 * `Update {n}` below prints {@link CampaignUpdate.number} and never an index into the array.
 * A `row_number()` at render time would renumber every earlier update the first time one was
 * withheld, and it would do it silently.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing is filtered here, and that is the rule rather than an omission</h2>
 *
 * §4.9 is explicit that `BACKERS_ONLY` is enforced by the service, which withholds such an
 * update from anybody outside the campaign's team. The list that arrives is already the list
 * this caller may see. <strong>A client-side filter would be a second, weaker copy of an
 * entitlement rule</strong>, and the first time the two disagreed the weaker one would decide
 * whether a private update went into public HTML.
 *
 * The badge is still rendered, because being able to see a backers-only update and knowing
 * that not everybody can are two different things — and a backer forwarding a link is
 * entitled to know which they are forwarding.
 *
 * <h2>"Comments on updates" is C-05 and is not built</h2>
 *
 * §4.4's table says updates carry comments and §4.9 lists C-05 among the things that do not
 * exist yet: there is no endpoint that would attach a comment to an update, and the comment
 * endpoints address a campaign rather than an update. So there is no comment control here.
 * One that posted to the campaign thread instead would file a reply about update 7 under the
 * campaign at large, where nobody reading update 7 would find it.
 *
 * <h2>Motion</h2>
 *
 * None. docs/motion-system.md §8 forbids animation in long content, and an update is long
 * content: a paragraph that fades in as it is scrolled past is a paragraph somebody is trying
 * to read.
