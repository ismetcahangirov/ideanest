/**
 * Writing a comment, and answering one — §4.9's C-01 and C-03, issue #285.
 *
 * <h2>One component for both, because they are one form</h2>
 *
 * A new conversation and a reply differ by the endpoint they post to and by nothing a reader
 * can see: the same textarea, the same signed-out branch, the same rate-limit message, the
 * same refresh afterwards. Two components would be two places for the 429 wording to drift
 * and two places to forget that the list has to be re-read.
 *
 * <h2>It does not build the new comment; it asks the server to render the list again</h2>
 *
 * `router.refresh()` re-runs the Server Component that fetched the threads, and the new
 * comment arrives in the next render of the list. Splicing it into local state instead would
 * mean this component deciding where a reply nests, where a thread sorts, and whether the
 * author counts as the campaign — and §4.9 settles all three on the server precisely because
 * a client cannot be trusted with them. `by_creator` in particular "is never accepted from
 * the request body, where it would be a claim of authority made by the side making the
 * claim", and a client that rendered its own new comment would be doing exactly that.
 *
 * The cost is a round trip before the comment appears. That is the right trade on a surface
 * where the alternative is a comment that looks posted and is not.
 *
 * <h2>Signed out is a link, never a form</h2>
 *
 * The write needs a bearer token, and §4.9 gives the reason it is a mechanism rather than
 * friction. `ReportControl` on this same page resolves the identical question the same way:
 * offer a sign-in that comes back here, and never a box that collects somebody's paragraph
 * and loses it at the last step.
 *
 * <h2>What it deliberately does not validate</h2>
 *
 * Only "something was typed". §10.2 publishes no length bound on a comment body, so a maximum
 * invented here would refuse a long comment the platform would have accepted, and nobody
 * could find the rule that refused it. `isSubmittableComment` says the same thing from the
 * lib side.
 *
 * <h2>Motion</h2>
 *
 * None. docs/motion-system.md §5 gives this page a moderate budget and nothing in it is spent
 * on a form; §9.4 of docs/ui-kit.md also puts an error message here, and an animated error is
 * one that arrives after it was needed.
