/**
 * §5.5's monthly update, stated on the campaign page — issue #437, surfaced by #439.
 *
 * <h2>A fact, not a verdict</h2>
 *
 * §22.3 asks for "the creator's project history visible", and #437 is explicit about what that
 * has to look like: "not a badge of shame — a fact, stated neutrally, with the date of the last
 * update". So this says when the creator last posted and when the next update was due, and it
 * says nothing about what that means about them. A reader draws the conclusion; the platform
 * supplies the dates.
 *
 * It also never appears alone as an accusation. A creator who is up to date gets nothing at
 * all, and one who has finished fulfilling gets a sentence saying so — because a panel that
 * only ever appeared when something was wrong would be a badge by its presence, whatever the
 * words in it said.
 *
 * <h2>Colour carries nothing, and it is deliberately not lime</h2>
 *
 * CLAUDE.md: colour alone must never carry meaning. The state is in the words and in the icon,
 * and the panel is the same neutral surface `CampaignTrustBlock` uses in every state.
 *
 * <strong>`--lime-500` in particular is wrong here</strong>, and not merely unnecessary.
 * docs/ui-kit.md §2.4 gives lime one meaning — "act now" — addressed to the person reading the
 * page. The person who has to act on a late update is the creator, who is not reading this; to
 * a backer, lime would read as a call to do something about a situation the platform has just
 * told them it only mediates.
 *
 * `--success` is equally wrong for the completed state, for the mirror of the same reason: it
 * would read as the platform certifying that the rewards arrived, which is a claim about
 * somebody else's delivery that nobody here has checked. The completed sentence is the same
 * neutral panel with a different icon and different words.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 — motion decreases as money gets closer. This sits beside the trust
 * block on the page where somebody is deciding whether to pledge, and a panel about whether a
 * creator keeps their promises, fading in, reads as hesitation about the answer.
 *
 * <h2>The date is UTC on the server and the reader's zone after hydration is deliberately not
 * done</h2>
 *
 * Unlike the deadline, which `ViewerInstant` re-renders in the reader's own zone. A deadline is
 * a moment somebody has to act before, so an hour matters; this is "last posted on 14 March",
 * where a zone boundary changes the day at most and the cost of getting it is a client island
 * on a page whose largest contentful paint is the subject of #119.
