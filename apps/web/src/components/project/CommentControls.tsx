/**
 * What a signed-in reader may do about one comment — §4.9's C-03, C-07 and the withdrawal.
 *
 * <h2>One island per comment, not three</h2>
 *
 * Replying, withdrawing and reporting all need the session, and two of the three need a write.
 * Mounting them separately would put three context consumers under every comment on the page;
 * one component that renders whichever of the three apply is one subscription and one prop
 * object per row. `ReportControl` is mounted from in here rather than from the server list for
 * the same reason — it is already a client component, and reaching it through this one keeps
 * a comment row to a single boundary.
 *
 * <h2>The reply control is placed by `acceptsReplies` and never by arithmetic</h2>
 *
 * §4.9's thread depth is bounded at one and states the rule three times over — the domain
 * refuses it, a database constraint refuses it under a support script, and every row carries
 * `acceptsReplies` "so a client places the reply control rather than discovering the rule by
 * being refused". This reads that flag. `depth === 0` recomputed here would be a fourth
 * statement of the rule, and the day it disagreed it would offer somebody a form the server
 * was always going to reject with a 422.
 *
 * <h2>Withdrawing is offered only to the author, and the server decides anyway</h2>
 *
 * `DELETE /v1/comments/{id}` also accepts the campaign's team (CD-14) and platform staff
 * (AD-09). Neither is offered from here, because this page has no way to know whether the
 * reader is on the campaign's team: `GET /v1/projects/{creatorSlug}/{projectSlug}` carries
 * the creator's slug, name and avatar and no collaborator list, and inventing the check from
 * "is the reader's slug the creator's slug" would be an authorisation decision made in a
 * browser. The creator's own removals belong on the dashboard (CD-14), which has the
 * authority to make them.
 *
 * So the control appears when the signed-in account wrote the comment, which is a comparison
 * of two identifiers the page already holds — and the server re-decides it regardless, which
 * is the only decision that counts.
 *
 * <h2>The wording is "withdraw", because §4.9 says it is not a removal</h2>
 *
 * The row stays, its body stays, and the read serves a tombstone. Calling the control
 * "Delete" would promise an erasure the platform deliberately does not perform — and somebody
 * pressing it to make a sentence disappear from the internet is entitled to know that it
 * will still be there, marked as withdrawn, for the moderator holding a report about it.
