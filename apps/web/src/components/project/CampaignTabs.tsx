/**
 * §4.4's tab list — issues #282, #283, #284 and #285, and the shell all four hang from.
 *
 * <h2>Links in a navigation landmark, and NOT an ARIA tab widget</h2>
 *
 * This looks like a tab strip and is deliberately not marked up as one. `role="tablist"`,
 * `role="tab"` and `aria-selected` are a contract with the reader: arrow keys move between
 * the tabs, one tab stop holds the whole group, focus stays inside the widget, and the panel
 * changes without the page moving. Every one of those requires JavaScript to manage roving
 * `tabindex` — which would make the tab shell a client boundary on the route #119 exists to
 * keep server-rendered — and the last one would be a lie regardless, because activating one
 * of these performs a navigation.
 *
 * <strong>A widget whose roles promise behaviour it does not have is worse than no roles.</strong>
 * A screen reader user told "tab, 2 of 5" presses the right arrow and nothing happens. So
 * these are what they actually are: links, in a `<nav>` with a name, in a list, with
 * `aria-current="page"` on the one being read. That is a pattern every assistive technology
 * already understands, it needs no JavaScript, every browser's own keyboard handling works,
 * and a crawler follows it.
 *
 * `lib/projects/tabs.ts` argues the other half of this — why the tab is a query parameter
 * rather than local state or a route per tab, and which of §4.4's seven tabs exist.
 *
 * <h2>Server-rendered, and nothing here is a boundary</h2>
 *
 * No state, no handler, no hook. The active tab arrives as a prop because the page read it
 * from the address, so the correct tab is in the HTML rather than chosen after hydration —
 * which is what makes a link to the Comments tab open the comments for somebody whose
 * JavaScript never arrives.
 *
 * <h2>Colour and focus</h2>
 *
 * The current tab is white text over a white rule; the rest are `--text-secondary` (§2.2,
 * 9.2:1). <strong>No lime</strong>: lime is "act now" (§2.4) and a tab is a place, not an
 * urgency. Colour is not the only signal either — `aria-current` carries it to a screen
 * reader and the weight change carries it to somebody who cannot separate the two greys
 * (§9.2). The focus ring is the kit's lime outline on a dark ground, which §9.3 permits and
 * which is the one place lime belongs on this component.

        THE ROW SCROLLS RATHER THAN WRAPPING, AND #283 IS THE DAY THAT STARTED MATTERING.

        This comment used to say "four tabs fit on a phone; the day a fifth is added…". The
        FAQ tab is the fifth. Five labels — Campaign, Creator, FAQ, Updates, Comments — are
        roughly 450px of pills at this size, against about 320px of content width on a 360px
        phone, so the row genuinely overflows now rather than hypothetically.

        Nothing had to change for it. `flex` without `flex-wrap` cannot wrap, every label
        carries `whitespace-nowrap` so no label breaks mid-word, and `overflow-x-auto` makes
        the surplus a horizontal scroll instead of a second row that would push the campaign's
        own content down by a line on exactly the viewports where vertical space is scarcest.

        The scroll is not a keyboard trap and needs no script: these are links, so Tab moves
        through them and the browser scrolls each one into view on focus.
