/**
 * §4.4's Creator tab — #282.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER:
 *
 *   - **an absent field is an omitted row, never a placeholder.** §4.4 asks for "biography,
 *     history, previous projects, contact" and the platform publishes two of the four. On a
 *     page whose subject is whether to send somebody money, "Member since —" is a statement
 *     about the creator made out of the absence of a field.
 *   - **no count is printed.** There is no campaign count on the profile — counting one inside
 *     the `user` module would give it a dependency on `project` and `pledge` — and a count
 *     taken from the length of a capped list would understate a prolific creator.
 *   - **no contact control.** §4.9's C-12 is half built and there is no endpoint that would
 *     carry a message to this creator; a contact button that opened a mail client would be
 *     the platform pretending to have a feature.
 *   - **a private or missing profile degrades to the byline and explains nothing.** The
 *     endpoint answers 404 for an unknown slug, a deleted account and a private one alike, and
 *     an interface that said "this profile is private" would rebuild the oracle that 404
 *     exists to close.
