/**
 * §4.4's Comments tab — issue #285, over §4.9's C-01, C-02, C-03 and C-07.
 *
 * <h2>The list is server-rendered; only the writing is not</h2>
 *
 * The read is `permitAll` and the conversation under a campaign is public content, so it is
 * in the initial HTML like the story above it. The three client boundaries beneath this
 * component are the three things that need a session — the composer, and one control group per
 * comment — and each argues itself in its own file.
 *
 * <h2>Chronological, and the order is the service's</h2>
 *
 * §4.4 asks for a chronological thread. Nothing here sorts: the service pages by a keyset over
 * a UUID v7 that agrees with `created_at`, so re-sorting in the browser would reorder the page
 * relative to the cursor that produced it — and the first symptom would be a comment appearing
 * twice across two pages.
 *
 * <h2>The creator highlight is a flag, a word and a border — never a colour alone</h2>
 *
 * C-02 asks for the campaign's own replies to be distinguished. `byCreator` is settled by the
 * server at write time, from `ProjectAccess`, and §4.9 explains why: taken from the request
 * body it would be a claim of authority made by the side making the claim, and derived on read
 * it would silently vanish the day its author left the team.
 *
 * So the highlight reads that field, and it is drawn three ways at once: a tag that says
 * "From the campaign", a left border, and a lighter surface. docs/ui-kit.md §9.2 forbids
 * colour carrying meaning on its own, and "this answer is from the person asking for the
 * money" is precisely the kind of meaning that must not depend on being able to see a border
 * tint.
 *
 * <strong>Not lime.</strong> §2.4: lime says "act now". A creator's reply is not urgent, it is
 * authoritative, and lime here would compete with the countdown that is the one urgent thing
 * on this page.
 *
 * <h2>A withdrawn comment is a tombstone, and the row stays</h2>
 *
 * §4.9 gives three independent reasons, each sufficient: replies must not be orphaned when
 * their root goes, a moderator holding a report has to be able to read what it said, and
 * "removed" printed beside a name is an accusation published to everybody on the page. The
 * service therefore serves `body: null`, `authorId: null`, `deleted: true`, and this renders
 * that as a note in place — never as a gap, and never with the withdrawal attributed to
 * anybody.
 *
 * No controls under a tombstone. There is nothing to reply to that would not be better placed
 * under the thread, nothing to withdraw twice, and nothing left for a moderator to read if it
 * were reported.
 *
 * <h2>NOBODY IS NAMED, AND THAT IS A GAP RATHER THAN A DESIGN</h2>
 *
 * `CommentResponse` carries `authorId` — an account identifier — and no display name, no slug
 * and no avatar. The public profile read is addressed by slug (`GET /v1/users/{slug}`), so
 * there is no endpoint that turns the one into the other, and the campaign response carries
 * the creator's slug and name but not their id. This is the same shape of gap the page's own
 * comment describes about reporting the creator's account.
 *
 * The honest consequence is a thread where the campaign's replies are marked and everybody
 * else is unattributed. <strong>Nothing is invented to fill it</strong>: a byline reading
 * "Backer" would be a claim about somebody's relationship to the campaign that §4.9 says the
 * service does not currently check, and one reading "Anonymous" would be a claim they chose
 * it. Whoever adds a public name to the comment projection closes it, and this component
 * gains a byline and nothing else.
 *
 * <h2>Motion</h2>
 *
 * None. This tab reads as long content and docs/motion-system.md §8 forbids animation in it.
