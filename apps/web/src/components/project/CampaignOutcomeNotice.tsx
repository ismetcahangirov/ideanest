/**
 * What happened at the deadline — §5.1, as a backer reads it.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a separate block from the funding figures</h2>
 *
 * `CampaignSummary` shows what the campaign has raised <em>now</em>. This shows what it had
 * raised when it closed, and V29 is the argument for the difference: the live total keeps
 * moving after the deadline as cards are refused, pledges are dropped and charges are
 * refunded, so a campaign that funded at 125% drifts downwards for weeks afterwards. #63's
 * rule is that a later collection failure reduces the payout and never the outcome — a page
 * that showed only the live total would eventually contradict the word "Funded" printed
 * beside it.
 *
 * So both numbers are on the page, each labelled as what it is. A backer looking at a
 * closed campaign is entitled to know it succeeded and entitled to know what has actually
 * been collected since; conflating them is how somebody concludes their pledge vanished.
 *
 * <h2>Colour</h2>
 *
 * `--success` for a campaign that funded and a neutral surface for one that did not.
 * **Never lime for either** (ui-kit §2.4): lime means "act now", and there is nothing left
 * to act on. Both carry an icon and a sentence, because colour alone carries no meaning
 * (§9.2) — and "did not fund" is precisely the message a reader must not have to infer from
 * a hue.
