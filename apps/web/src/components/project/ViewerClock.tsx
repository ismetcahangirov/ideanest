/**
 * The two things only the reader's browser knows: what time it is now, and what zone they
 * are in. §4.4's live countdown and its "deadline in the viewer's timezone" — issue #281.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a client boundary, and why it is only one</h2>
 *
 * The campaign page's own comment says what a boundary costs on this route and #119 is why.
 * Two facts on this page are genuinely unavailable to a server render and neither can be
 * faked:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>The current time.</strong> A countdown rendered once on the server is a
 *       countdown that is wrong by however long the reader has had the tab open, and the
 *       page is cached for a minute besides, so the server's answer is stale before it is
 *       sent.
 *   <li><strong>The reader's time zone.</strong> Nothing carries it. It is not in a header,
 *       and a cookie that carried it would make this page uncacheable — which is the
 *       arrangement §4.4 exists to protect.
 * </ul>
 *
 * They are <strong>one</strong> boundary rather than two because they are one question asked
 * of one object. A separate module for the date would double the props crossing the
 * server/client seam for no reduction in shipped code: a bundler puts both in the same chunk
 * either way.
 *
 * <h2>Both components render the server's answer first, then correct it</h2>
 *
 * Every value below is passed in already formatted by the server and held as the initial
 * state. That is what makes the markup identical on both sides of hydration; computing the
 * first value in the browser instead would produce a countdown a minute out from the HTML it
 * is replacing, which React reports as a mismatch and repairs by throwing the server's
 * render away.
 *
 * It is also what makes the page work with no JavaScript at all: the countdown reads the
 * value the server computed and the deadline reads as a UTC instant. Neither is a spinner,
 * and neither is empty.
 *
 * <h2>The countdown does not shout</h2>
 *
 * `role="timer"` — whose implicit `aria-live` is `off`, restated here explicitly because
 * "restated" is cheaper than "assumed" — so a screen reader announces the value when the
 * reader arrives at it and never again. A `role="status"` or an `aria-live="polite"` region
 * here would interrupt whatever is being read, once a minute, for the whole time the page is
 * open, to say a number that has changed by one.
 *
 * The accessible name carries the whole sentence, because "2 days, 4 hours" announced on its
 * own is a quantity of nothing.
 *
 * <h2>Motion</h2>
 *
 * None. docs/motion-system.md §6 puts countdowns under "a number that changes, not a number
 * that animates", and §5 gives this page a moderate budget that this component spends none
 * of. Nothing here imports `@ideanest/ui/motion`.
