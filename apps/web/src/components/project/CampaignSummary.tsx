/**
 * §4.4's header: the cover, the title, who made it, and how the funding stands.
 *
 * <h2>A Server Component, and that is the point of the file</h2>
 *
 * #119's complaint is that the campaign page assembled itself in the browser, so the
 * title, the summary, the creator's name and the funding figures were absent from the
 * HTML a crawler and a link unfurler are served. This component itself is a Server
 * Component and nothing here fetches: every value is read from a projection the server
 * already has.
 *
 * <strong>Three islands hang beneath it, and each one is a fact the server does not have
 * rather than content it declined to render.</strong> `LiveFunding` starts from the
 * server's figures and adds §12.1's deltas. `CampaignCountdown` needs the current time,
 * which is stale the moment a cached page is sent. `CampaignActions` needs the session and
 * the clipboard. Every one of them renders the server's answer first, so the complete
 * document is still what a crawler and a reader with no JavaScript are served; each file
 * argues its own boundary, and #281 added the last two.
 *
 * <h2>Colour</h2>
 *
 * **Lime is urgency and nothing else** (docs/ui-kit.md §2.4, §8.1). A campaign closing
 * within 48 hours gets a lime pill with near-black text; a campaign that funded gets
 * `--success`, on the progress bar and on the word beside it. The two are one token apart
 * and opposite in meaning — a backer who reads lime as "done" has been told the reverse.
 *
 * **Colour never carries meaning alone** (§9.2). Every badge here is a hue plus an icon
 * plus a word, and the completion figure is printed as text as well as drawn as a bar,
 * because a bar that only changes colour has said nothing to a screen reader.
 *
 * <h2>Motion</h2>
 *
 * None, and there is none on the page above it either — `page.tsx` sets out why the route
 * declines its moderate budget (docs/motion-system.md §5) rather than paying 116 kB of
 * animation runtime to fade one heading in. A header that animated its funding figures would
 * animate the number a backer is trying to read, and §6's rule for countdowns says the same
 * of the one added by #281: it is a number that changes, not a number that moves.
