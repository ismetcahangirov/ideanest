/**
 * §4.4's Creator tab — issue #282.
 *
 * <h2>Every row is a field that exists, and the missing ones are named rather than filled</h2>
 *
 * §4.4 asks this tab for "biography, history, previous projects, contact".
 * `lib/projects/creatorProfile.ts` sets out what the platform actually publishes and what it
 * does not; the short version, as it lands on the page:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Biography</strong> — `bio` on `GET /v1/users/{slug}`. It arrives as an
 *       explicit `null` when the creator has written none, so an absent biography is a
 *       creator who has not written one and never a value still in flight. The row is
 *       omitted; a box saying "This creator has not written a biography" would put a small
 *       accusation on the page of everybody who has not got round to it.
 *   <li><strong>Previous projects</strong> — `GET /v1/users/{slug}/projects`, minus the
 *       campaign being read.
 *   <li><strong>History as a figure</strong> — not published, and structurally so: counting a
 *       creator's campaigns inside the `user` module would give it a dependency on `project`
 *       and `pledge` that the module-boundary test refuses. <strong>Nothing here prints a
 *       total.</strong> The list below is capped, so a count taken from its length would
 *       understate a prolific creator, and a count taken from nowhere would be invented.
 *   <li><strong>Contact</strong> — there is no endpoint. §4.9's C-12 is half built: a creator
 *       can message their backers and the reply half does not exist, so this page has nothing
 *       that would carry a message to this creator. No control is offered, because a contact
 *       control that opens a mail client the platform knows nothing about is the platform
 *       pretending to have a feature.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>A private or missing profile degrades to the byline</h2>
 *
 * `GET /v1/users/{slug}` answers 404 — never 403 — for an unknown slug, a deleted account and
 * an account that has chosen `PRIVATE`. The three are indistinguishable on purpose: a 403
 * would confirm that a given handle belongs to somebody who has chosen not to be listed.
 *
 * So a `null` profile renders the creator's name and avatar from the campaign response, which
 * is the same byline the header already shows, and <strong>no profile link and no
 * explanation</strong>. "This creator's profile is private" would rebuild in the interface
 * exactly the oracle the 404 exists to close.
 *
 * <h2>Why the discovery card is not reused for the project list</h2>
 *
 * `components/discovery/ProjectCard` renders the feed's projection, which carries a
 * `completionPercent` the service computes and a `badge` from §4.3's five status words.
 * `ProfileProjectCard` has neither. Mapping one to the other would mean computing a
 * percentage here and inventing a badge — a second implementation of both, on a tab, where
 * the first disagreement would be visible as one campaign showing two different completion
 * figures on two pages. A compact row is the honest shape for what this endpoint sends.
 *
 * <h2>Follow — #143</h2>
 *
 * `FollowControl` sits under the creator's name. It is addressed by the campaign's
 * `creator.slug`, which is there even when the profile is private, so a reader can follow the
 * person whose campaign they are reading either way — following says nothing about whether a
 * profile is public, and the control draws the same in both cases. It is the tab's one new
 * client boundary: the owner sees nothing, a visitor sees a sign-in link, and everybody else
 * the toggle.
 *
 * <h2>Every word is the catalogue's — #172</h2>
 *
 * The state words, "Member since" and the link to the profile were English literals in every
 * language after #132 and #142 had translated the rest of the page. This is a server component,
 * so it reads the catalogue directly, as `CampaignRisks` and `CampaignUpdates` do; a copy prop
 * would be ceremony between it and the request. The state words are `campaign.state`, the
 * group the campaign header's badge already reads, so a campaign is called the same thing on
 * its own page and in somebody else's Creator tab. The joining date is formatted in the
 * route's language by `formatDay`, and `ViewerInstant` re-renders it in the same language.
 *
 * <h2>Motion</h2>
 *
 * None. `ViewerInstant` and `FollowControl` are the tab's client boundaries, and neither
 * animates.
