/**
 * §4.4's tab strip — #282, #283, #284, #285.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER:
 *
 *   - **the FAQ tab is in the strip and it is a link to `?tab=faq`.** #283's tab is only
 *     reachable if it is an address: a crawler follows a link, a reader can send one, and
 *     somebody whose JavaScript never arrives can still open it.
 *   - **this is a list of links and NOT an ARIA tab widget** (docs/architecture.md §4.4).
 *     `role="tab"` promises arrow-key movement and a panel that changes without navigating,
 *     and both would be lies here. A widget whose roles promise behaviour it does not have is
 *     worse than no roles at all, so the test asserts the roles are absent rather than
 *     present.
 *   - **the current tab is marked in more than a colour.** `aria-current="page"` carries it to
 *     a screen reader and a weight change carries it to somebody who cannot separate two greys
 *     (docs/ui-kit.md §9.2).
 *   - **the default tab is the bare path.** `?tab=campaign` and the bare path are the same
 *     page, and the moment the strip produces both, one campaign has two addresses.
 *   - **the row cannot wrap.** Five labels do not fit across a phone, and a wrapped second row
 *     would push the campaign's content down by a line on exactly the narrow viewports where
 *     vertical space is scarcest — so the row scrolls instead.
