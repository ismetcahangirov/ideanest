/**
 * §4.4's FAQ tab — #283.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER:
 *
 *   - **the entries are on screen in the order the service sent them.** `sort_order` is what
 *     the editor's move controls write and what a backer reads down. A component that sorted
 *     would discard the creator's decision about which question is read first.
 *   - **"could not be loaded" and "has answered nothing" are different sentences.** This is
 *     the distinction the tab waited for an endpoint in order to be able to make: before
 *     `project_faqs` existed, the second sentence would have been printed on every campaign
 *     on the platform, as a claim about each creator that was really a statement about the
 *     software.
 *   - **an answer is text, never markup**, and its line breaks survive. An answer reaches
 *     this component as a string a creator typed, from a public endpoint, with no schema
 *     behind it at all — injecting it as markup would make the campaign page a cross-site
 *     scripting vector on the origin that holds the session.
 *   - **every question is a heading**, so a screen-reader user can move between them instead
 *     of reading every answer to find the next question.
 *   - **nothing is hidden behind a disclosure.** The component's own doc comment argues it:
 *     collapsed text is text the browser's find-in-page does not match, and a backer looking
 *     for "Germany" concludes the campaign never said.
