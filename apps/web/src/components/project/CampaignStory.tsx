/**
 * The creator's story, rendered — docs/ui-kit.md §8.4, the long-form exception.
 *
 * <h2>This is the reason #119 exists</h2>
 *
 * A campaign page whose body is fetched by the browser is a campaign page whose body is
 * not in the HTML: the two thousand words a creator wrote about what they are making are
 * the entire content of the page, and a crawler served an empty `<div>` has been told the
 * campaign is about nothing. Everything below is a Server Component and nothing below
 * fetches.
 *
 * <h2>The long-form exception, applied exactly as §8.4 states it</h2>
 *
 * Four changes from the system and no more: a lighter ground (`--surface-2`), softer body
 * text (`--text-reading`), generous leading, and a measure limit of 68 characters.
 * Headings stay `--text-primary`. The system is unchanged; two thousand words simply
 * become readable, and a reader who has scrolled this far is reading rather than scanning.
 *
 * <h2>No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, anywhere</h2>
 *
 * The story is a structured document — #35 gave it a schema and `readStoryDocument`
 * validates it — so every block below is rendered as elements. That is not a stylistic
 * preference: the document is text a creator typed, it reaches this component from a
 * public endpoint, and injecting it as markup would make a campaign page a cross-site
 * scripting vector on the origin that holds the session cookie.
 *
 * <h2>Motion</h2>
 *
 * None. §8 of docs/motion-system.md forbids animation in long content outright, and a
 * paragraph that fades in as it is scrolled past is a paragraph somebody is trying to read.
