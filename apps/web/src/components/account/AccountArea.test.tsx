/**
 * The account frame's language scoping and its copy — §21.1, issues #324 and #275.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COVERS.
 *
 * The frame declares the language of the copy it resolved. That used to be an override of an
 * `<html lang="en">` the root layout hard-coded; since #123 the document carries the route's
 * own locale and this restates it. The assertion is unchanged and still worth making — it says
 * the element wrapping the translated navigation announces the language that navigation is
 * written in, which is what stops a screen reader pronouncing Russian with English phonetics,
 * and it is a defect nobody sees in a screenshot.
 *
 * It also covers the lookup itself, which moved here when the client provider was removed.
 * `AccountNav` is handed strings now, so this frame is the only place a key becomes a
 * sentence, and asking for the wrong one — `links.saved` instead of `links.saved.label` — is
 * a mistake no data test can catch. The assertions below are therefore about rendered output,
 * in all four languages, through the real catalogues.
 *
 * WHAT IT MOCKS, AND WHY.
 *
 *   - `next-intl/server`, because `getLocale()` and `getTranslations()` read a request-scoped
 *     store that only exists inside a Next render. The mock is the negotiated answer that
 *     `i18n/request.ts` would have produced, resolving against the real `messages/*.json` so
 *     that a wrong key fails here rather than rendering its own dotted name.
 *   - `next-intl`'s `NextIntlClientProvider`, as a marker that must never appear — see the
 *     page-weight test at the bottom.
 *   - `SiteShell`, down to a marker plus its children. The real one renders the header, the
 *     footer, and a session boundary — none of which this component decides anything about,
 *     and all of which would make a failure here ambiguous. What matters for the language
 *     claim is only that the shell's own chrome is *outside* the element carrying `lang`,
 *     and the stand-in below keeps that arrangement.

 * is worse than a wrong label — and that choice is only safe while something fails on the
 * wrong label instead. This is that something.
