/**
 * The frame every account screen renders inside — §4.2 and §4.13 WS-01, issue #275.
 *
 * <h2>It takes the site shell, and the authentication screens do not</h2>
 *
 * `app/(auth)` uses `MinimalShell` because a sign-in page is a screen with one job and the
 * header's job is to offer eleven others. **The account area is the opposite case.** Somebody
 * managing their notifications is already signed in, is not mid-transaction, and the most
 * likely next thing they want is a campaign — so taking the navigation away would be taking
 * away the way out. `apps/web/README.md`'s route table records the move.
 *
 * <h2>The navigation is beside the content, not above it</h2>
 *
 * docs/ui-kit.md §6.3 puts a rail on the left of a working surface, and this is one: thirteen
 * destinations somebody moves between, several times, in one sitting. Above the content it
 * would push the page down on every screen and would compete with the site header a few
 * pixels above it.
 *
 * <h2>No second `<main>`</h2>
 *
 * `SiteShell` owns the only one on the page, and the screens under this used to declare their
 * own — `/settings/sessions` and `/settings/notifications` both did, because they had no
 * shell to be inside. Two `<main>` elements is not a duplicated landmark so much as an
 * ambiguous one: assistive technology offers "jump to main" and there is now more than one
 * answer. Both pages were changed in the same pull request that gave them this frame.
 *
 * <h2>It is the translation boundary — §21.1, issue #324</h2>
 *
 * Two things happen on this frame and nowhere else, because this is the only element every
 * account screen is inside and the only one whose subtree is exactly the translated half of
 * the site.
 *
 * **THE NAVIGATION'S WORDS ARE RESOLVED HERE, ON THE SERVER, AND GO DOWN AS PLAIN STRINGS.**
 * `AccountNav` is a client boundary — it needs `usePathname` to mark one entry
 * `aria-current="page"` — and the first version of this file answered that by wrapping it in
 * `NextIntlClientProvider` so it could call `useTranslations` itself. It worked, and it cost
 * more than it bought: the provider puts next-intl's **client** runtime plus the serialised
 * `account` namespace into the First Load JS of every route in the area, whether or not that
 * route draws anything else from the catalogue. Sixteen budgets broke on it at once —
 * `/settings/sessions` by 27.4 KiB, `/settings/notifications` by 23.5, `/settings/email` by
 * 16.4, `/settings` and `/account` by 11.1 each, `/settings/profile` by 7.7 — and
 * `apps/web/performance/README.md` asks what the kilobytes bought. A navigation bar's labels
 * are not an answer to that question.
 *
 * `getTranslations('account')` reads the same catalogue `i18n/request.ts` negotiated for this
 * render, on the server, where it is already open and costs the browser nothing. Sixteen
 * strings cross the boundary instead of the machinery for looking sixteen strings up, and the
 * result is identical in every language. `app/settings/language/page.tsx` and
 * `components/settings/LanguagePanel.tsx` make the same trade a screen deeper, and there is
 * now no `NextIntlClientProvider` anywhere in this subtree: nothing under this frame calls
 * `useTranslations`, and anything that starts to should be given props rather than a provider.
 *
 * **`lang` ON THIS `<div>`, DELIBERATELY NOT ON `<html>`.** `app/layout.tsx` hard-codes
 * `lang={SITE_LANGUAGE}`, and it must keep doing so: that layout wraps the cached public
 * routes as well as this one, and reading a locale there would make every route on the site
 * dynamic — the exact cost `i18n/request.ts` documents refusing to pay for a navigation bar.
 * So the document stays `en` and this subtree overrides it, which is not a workaround but the
 * mechanism HTML provides for a page in more than one language.
 *
 * And this page IS in more than one language, which is why the attribute cannot simply be
 * left off. `SiteShell` renders the header and the footer as siblings of this `<div>`, and
 * both are still English literals; the content inside it is drawn from the catalogue. Without
 * the override a screen reader pronounces Russian navigation with English phonetics, which
 * does not read as a translation defect to the person hearing it — it reads as noise. With
 * it, each half is announced in the language it is actually written in.
