/**
 * The account area's own navigation — §4.2, issue #275.
 *
 * <h2>A client boundary, and only for `usePathname`</h2>
 *
 * Nothing here has state and nothing fetches. What it needs is the current path, to mark one
 * entry `aria-current="page"`, and that is not knowable in a layout on the server without
 * threading it down from every page. One small boundary beside the content is the cheaper of
 * the two — the alternative is every page in the area passing its own path to its layout,
 * which is a rule somebody eventually forgets and nothing catches.
 *
 * <h2>`aria-current` carries it; the treatment is the second signal</h2>
 *
 * docs/ui-kit.md §9.2 forbids colour alone. The current entry is white on `--surface-2` with
 * a lime rule down its leading edge, and it is the `aria-current` that a screen reader reads.
 * Neither is sufficient on its own and both are present.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 puts "authentication, account settings" at **none — 150ms colour
 * on controls**. A navigation that animated between entries would be animating on every
 * screen in the area, on a surface whose whole job is to be worked in.
 *
 * <h2>It scrolls on its own axis on both, and the reason differs</h2>
 *
 * On a wide viewport the rail is sticky, so a rail taller than the screen used to have a
 * bottom nobody could reach: the page scrolled, the content on the right moved, and the rail
 * stayed pinned with its last group below the fold. It is its own scroll container since
 * #349, with `overscroll-contain` so reaching its end does not hand the wheel to the page.
 * The class list below argues each part, including the padding that keeps the focus ring from
 * being clipped by the container that fixed the first problem.
 *
 * <h2>It scrolls sideways on a phone, rather than collapsing</h2>
 *
 * Below the breakpoint the two groups become one horizontally scrolling row. A drawer would
 * be a second off-canvas panel in an application that already has one (WS-03) and would hide
 * the thirteen destinations behind a control, on the screens where somebody arrived
 * specifically to reach one of them.
 *
 * <h2>The words arrive as props, already translated — §21.1, issue #324</h2>
 *
 * `lib/account/navigation.ts` carries keys, and **the server resolves them.** This component
 * used to call `useTranslations('account')` under a `NextIntlClientProvider` that `AccountArea`
 * put above it, which worked and was expensive in exactly the way `apps/web/performance/README.md`
 * refuses to let pass unnoticed: the provider drags next-intl's client runtime plus the whole
 * serialised `account` namespace into the First Load JS of **every** route in the area. That
 * broke sixteen budgets at once — `/settings/sessions` by 27.4 KiB, `/settings/notifications`
 * by 23.5, `/settings` and `/account` by 11.1 each, `/settings/profile` by 7.7 — and a
 * navigation bar's labels did not buy 27 KiB.
 *
 * So the boundary stays (it is still the only way to know the path) and the catalogue does
 * not cross it. `AccountArea` reads `account.*` through `getTranslations` on the server and
 * hands down the sixteen strings this file draws; the browser downloads those sixteen strings
 * instead of the machinery to look them up. `components/settings/LanguagePanel.tsx` makes the
 * same trade for the same reason and states it from the panel's side.
 *
 * THE LANDMARK'S NAME IS TRANSLATED TOO, and it is the one string in this file a sighted
 * reader would never have noticed was wrong. `aria-label` is read aloud and nothing else, so a
 * Russian navigation announced as "Account" is a defect only a screen-reader user meets —
 * which is exactly the kind of string a catalogue is for. It arrives as `label`, resolved from
 * `account.nav.label` in all four languages, beside the entries it names.

          THE RAIL SCROLLS ON ITS OWN Y AXIS — #349. `sticky` pins it below the header and
          keeps it there while the page moves, which is the point of it; the consequence,
          until this, was that a rail taller than the viewport had a bottom nobody could
          reach. Scrolling the page moved the content on the right and left the rail exactly
          where it was. Thirteen destinations at 150% zoom, or a laptop at 768px of height,
          is enough for the last group to be unreachable.

          `100dvh` and not `100vh`: the dynamic unit is the one that tracks a collapsing
          browser toolbar, and `vh` here would size the rail to a viewport the reader does
          not have. `8rem` is the `top-24` above it (6rem) plus 2rem so the last entry does
          not sit flush against the bottom edge.

          `overscroll-contain` is the half that makes it independent rather than merely
          scrollable: without it, reaching the end of the rail hands the wheel to the page
          and the reader scrolls the article they were not looking at.
