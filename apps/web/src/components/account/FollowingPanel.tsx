/**
 * §4.9's C-10 — the creators this account follows. Issue #288.
 *
 * <h2>The rows do not link anywhere, and that is deliberate</h2>
 *
 * A creator's page is `/users/{slug}`, which is #274 — and #274 cannot be built, because the
 * service publishes no `GET /v1/users/{slug}`. `UserAccounts.findBySlug` exists and nothing
 * exposes it. Linking a name to a route that does not exist would give every row on this
 * screen a 404 behind it, which is worse than a row that is plainly text: a broken link tells
 * a reader the platform is broken, and this one would be on the screen listing the people they
 * chose to follow.
 *
 * So the name is text, the slug is shown beside it — it is what the creator is addressed by
 * everywhere else, including in a campaign's URL — and the rows become links the day #274
 * lands. `apps/web/README.md` records the gap rather than leaving it to be noticed.
 *
 * <h2>Following exists to be told about a launch</h2>
 *
 * The screen says so, once, at the top of the list rather than on every row. It is the only
 * thing following actually does, and somebody looking at this list is usually deciding whether
 * to keep receiving those messages — which is a decision they cannot make without knowing what
 * they are.
