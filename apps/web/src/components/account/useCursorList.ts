/**
 * A cursor-paginated list, read once on mount and extended a page at a time.
 *
 * <h2>Why a hook rather than two copies</h2>
 *
 * The saved list and the following list (#288) are the same machine over different rows: one
 * read, one cursor, one "load more", one signed-out state, and one distinction between "the
 * service refused" and "the request was abandoned". Two copies of that would be two places for
 * the abort handling to be got wrong — and getting it wrong is silent, because an aborted
 * request that is treated as a failure only shows up as a flash of an error nobody can
 * reproduce.
 *
 * <h2>The cursor is never reset by a removal</h2>
 *
 * Unsaving a campaign takes its row out of local state and leaves the cursor alone. Refetching
 * from the start would drop every page the reader has already loaded and put them back at the
 * top of a list they were reading; the row they removed is the one thing they already know is
 * gone.
 *
 * <h2>Three states, and a fourth that is not an error</h2>
 *
 * `loading`, `ready` and `failed` — plus `signed-out`, which is what a 401 means here rather
 * than a failure to report. `SessionProvider`'s guard is what acts on it; this hook only has
 * to stop rendering a list it cannot read.
