/**
 * `/account/campaigns` — the screen a creator reaches their own unfinished work from.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER:
 *
 *   - **a draft points at the editor and a live campaign points at its page.** This is the
 *     property the screen exists for. `/projects/{creator}/{slug}` answers 404 for a draft,
 *     so a list that sent every row there would be a list of dead links to exactly the
 *     campaigns nobody could otherwise find — the bug this page was built to fix, restored.
 *   - **the state is rendered as a word.** docs/ui-kit.md §9.2 forbids colour from carrying
 *     meaning alone, and "submitted" and "changes requested" are a fortnight apart in what
 *     the creator should do next.
 *   - the empty state offers the way out rather than an apology, and it is the *empty* state
 *     rather than the failure one — a creator who has started nothing has not hit an error.
