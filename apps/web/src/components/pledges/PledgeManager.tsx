/**
 * One of the caller's own pledges, with §4.5's PL-09 edit. Issue #287.
 *
 * IDN-EXT-01 (#35) withdrew PL-10: a backer cannot cancel a pledge, and a confirmed one may only
 * be raised. The withdrawal panel that used to sit under the editor is gone.
 *
 * <h2>Two reads, and only one of them is the authority</h2>
 *
 * `GET /v1/pledges/{id}` is the pledge: its state, its six amounts, its add-ons, its
 * supplements, its destination. Everything on this screen that anybody acts on comes from it.
 *
 * `GET /v1/me/pledges` is asked a second question and one question only — **which campaign is
 * this?** `PledgeResponse` carries a `projectId` and no title and no slugs, and there is no
 * public read keyed on a campaign id alone, so the caller's own list is the only projection
 * that can name it (`lib/pledges/backer.ts` carries the argument and the bound). It is
 * best-effort: a pledge whose campaign could not be named still renders and still edits, because refusing to show somebody their own pledge over a missing heading
 * would be the worse failure.
 *
 * <h2>Whether the controls appear is decided by the PLEDGE's state, and not by the
 * campaign's</h2>
 *
 * `PledgeService#requireEditable` composes two facts owned by two different modules: the
 * pledge is `DRAFT` or `CONFIRMED`, **and** the campaign is still accepting pledges. This
 * component checks the first and deliberately does not check the second.
 *
 * The reason is that the client cannot check it correctly. `PledgeAcceptance` accepts a `LIVE`
 * campaign before its deadline and also a `LATE_PLEDGE` one inside a window it opened (PL-16),
 * and the summary above carries a state and a deadline but not the late-pledge window. A
 * client-side approximation of that rule would be a second rule, free to drift from the
 * service's, and its failure mode is the bad one: hiding the edit controls from somebody who is
 * still entitled to raise their pledge.
 *
 * So the controls are shown and the service decides. A campaign that has closed answers
 * `PROJECT_NOT_LIVE` — the same code, body and `meta.deadline` the draft endpoint gives — and
 * `lib/pledges/failure.ts` words it as "this campaign is not taking pledges. Nothing has
 * changed", which is an answer a backer can read. A control that is refused with a sentence is
 * better than a control that was never there.
 *
 * <h2>A paid pledge is raised, and the service says when — #171</h2>
 *
 * A `COLLECTED` pledge is not edited: it was charged when it was made, and raising it charges the
 * difference on the provider's page. Whether that is possible right now is the one fact this screen
 * does take from the service rather than leaving to a refusal, because the answer decides which of
 * two forms to draw: `raisable` is true only while the pledge is paid for and its campaign is taking
 * pledges. A paid pledge on a campaign that has closed gets the locked notice instead, whose sentence
 * says exactly that.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5: pledge and checkout are "near zero — every animation here reads as
 * hesitation". Nothing on this screen enters, fades or slides.
