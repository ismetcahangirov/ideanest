/**
 * §4.5's PL-09 — the backer changes their mind while the campaign runs. Issue #287.
 *
 * <h2>It is checkout's controls over a pledge that already exists</h2>
 *
 * `RewardChoice`, `AddonChoice`, `DestinationField` and `PledgeSummary` are imported from
 * `components/checkout` rather than rewritten. All four are controlled — value in, change out
 * — with no dependency on `useCheckout`, which is what makes the reuse possible and is why
 * they were built that way. The alternative is a second reward list with its own sold-out
 * rule, its own destination union, and its own opinion about which line refuses a country;
 * two of those would eventually disagree, and the one that is wrong would be the one nobody
 * looks at.
 *
 * The preview arithmetic is `lib/pledges/quote.ts`, for the same reason: it mirrors
 * `PledgeQuote` on the service line for line, and a second copy here would be a figure the
 * backer reads before pressing a button that then charges a different one.
 *
 * <h2>THE PATCH IS A DIFF, AND THAT IS NOT AN OPTIMISATION</h2>
 *
 * `PATCH /v1/pledges/{id}` takes JSON Merge-Patch semantics: **absent keeps, null clears**.
 * `"rewardTierId": null` gives up the reward and makes the pledge support-only; leaving the
 * key out keeps the tier. So sending every field on every save — the correct behaviour for the
 * shipping-address form, which replaces an address whole — would here strip the reward off a
 * pledge whose backer only raised their contribution.
 *
 * `changesFrom` below builds the body from what actually differs, field by field. It is also
 * what makes the idempotency key mean something: the key is derived from a canonical
 * serialisation of the body, so "the same intent" is an objective fact about the request
 * rather than a label somebody has to remember to change (`lib/pledges/idempotency.ts`).
 *
 * <h2>The server's answer replaces the form's, whole</h2>
 *
 * `PATCH` returns the entire `PledgeResponse` and the caller adopts it rather than merging
 * fields into a local copy. On this endpoint the total is what somebody will be charged, and
 * the client is working from a reward list it fetched some seconds ago — a price, a rate or a
 * tier's availability may have moved since. The server quotes against the row it is writing,
 * inside the transaction that writes it.
 *
 * <h2>Raising a paid pledge is the same form, and saving means paying the difference — #171</h2>
 *
 * A `COLLECTED` pledge was charged when it was made, so PL-09's `PATCH` does not reach it. In
 * `mode="raise"` the same controls build the same Merge-Patch diff, and the button sends it to
 * `POST /v1/pledges/{id}/raise` with the difference this form previews as `expectedAmount`, then
 * leaves for the provider's page to pay it. The service refuses to charge any other figure
 * (`RAISE_AMOUNT_CHANGED`), so what the backer reads beside the button is what the provider asks
 * for. Nothing on the pledge changes until the provider says the difference was paid; the manager
 * reads the outcome off `latestRaise` when the backer comes back.
 *
 * Only an increase is offered. A selection that costs no more than the pledge does now leaves the
 * button disabled with a sentence saying why, and the anonymity box is not drawn, because a raise
 * changes what is bought and not who is shown.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none, and this is the screen the rule was written for</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 gives pledge and checkout "near zero — every animation here reads
 * as hesitation". Nothing enters, nothing fades; the controls take the kit's 150ms colour
 * change and the button changes its label while the request is in flight.
