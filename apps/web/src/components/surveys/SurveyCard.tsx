/**
 * One survey, and the form that answers it — §4.8 PM-05 and PM-06. Issue #289.
 *
 * <h2>Answering twice is the same row, and the wording says so</h2>
 *
 * `BackerSurveyController` answers 200 even on a first submission, deliberately: PM-06 makes
 * this one row that moves rather than a new resource each time. So the control reads **Save
 * answers** and not Submit, before and after — a button labelled Submit that can be pressed
 * again is a button somebody is afraid to press.
 *
 * <h2>A closed survey renders read-only rather than disappearing</h2>
 *
 * A creator can close one after they have what they need. Hiding it would leave a backer
 * unable to check what they said about a reward that has not arrived yet; offering a form that
 * will 409 would be worse. The fields are disabled and the reason is on the card.
 *
 * <h2>Required questions are checked here as well as by the service</h2>
 *
 * Not instead of. The service is the enforcement — a client that skipped the check would be
 * refused — and this is the part that stops somebody submitting, waiting, and being told about
 * a question that scrolled off the top of the screen. The message names the question, and
 * focus is not stolen: docs/ui-kit.md §9.2 wants the error beside the field, and the field is
 * where the reader is already looking.
