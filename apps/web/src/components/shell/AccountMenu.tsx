/**
 * The signed-in reader's own corner of the header — §4.13 WS-01's "signed-in action pair".
 *
 * <h2>Built from the kit's hooks rather than from `Popover`</h2>
 *
 * `Popover` lives behind `@ideanest/ui/motion`, and this component is in the shell — on
 * every route in the site. Importing it would put 116 kB of animation runtime into the first
 * load of every page in the application, which is the exact regression `packages/ui/src/motion.ts`
 * was written to undo. So the panel is markup and CSS, and the two behaviours that actually
 * matter come from hooks that carry no such cost: `useDismiss` for Escape, and a pointer
 * listener for a click outside.
 *
 * It also costs nothing to leave out the animation, because it is not allowed one:
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 gives the shell §4.7's collapse and nothing else, and §5.1's rule
 * about panels — "a panel that animates while somebody is using it is a panel that is slower
 * to use" — applies to a menu more than to anything.
 *
 * <h2>What it is, in accessibility terms</h2>
 *
 * A disclosure, not a `menu`. The ARIA menu pattern brings arrow-key roving, `menuitem`
 * roles and the expectation that Tab leaves the whole widget, and it is meant for
 * application commands rather than for a short list of links. A button with
 * `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls` revealing a list of ordinary links is what this is, it
 * behaves the way the browser already behaves, and every row in it stays a real link that
 * can be opened in a new tab.
 *
 * The panel closes on Escape, on a click outside, and on a navigation — the last because
 * Next routes without unmounting the shell, so a menu left open would follow the reader onto
 * the page they just chose.
 *
 * <h2>The way into the console, and why it is asked for on open — issue #405</h2>
 *
 * Signed in as an account holding all four staff roles, `/admin` appeared in neither the
 * header, this menu, nor the footer. Staff reached the console by typing the URL, which is
 * not a route anybody discovers and is one people write down in the wrong places.
 *
 * <p><strong>The staff check happens when the menu is first opened, not on render.</strong>
 * This component is in the shell, so a check on render would be a request on every page view
 * by every signed-in visitor on the platform, to decide whether to draw one row that almost
 * nobody sees. Opening the menu is the moment the answer is needed, `GET /v1/admin/me`
 * refuses nobody and is a primary-key lookup, and it is asked once per mount.
 *
 * <p>A failure is not staff. The console refuses anybody who should not be there, so the
 * cost of being wrong in this direction is a row somebody has to reach by URL — which is
 * exactly where they were before — and the cost of being wrong in the other is a link to a
 * refusal in front of every backer on the site.
