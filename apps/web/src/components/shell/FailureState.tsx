/**
 * What a not-found, an error and a maintenance page have in common — §4.13 WS-09, issue #263.
 *
 * <h2>Three pages, one shape</h2>
 *
 * A short heading that says what happened, a sentence that says what it means, one action
 * that is the way out, and a small set of links so the page is not a dead end. Writing that
 * three times is writing three pages that drift, and the one that drifts is always the one
 * nobody visits on purpose.
 *
 * <h2>The status code is not carried here</h2>
 *
 * Next decides it: `not-found.tsx` is served with a 404, an uncaught render is a 500, and the
 * maintenance route is an ordinary 200 page somebody links to. Nothing in this component may
 * imply otherwise, because a "404" printed on a page served with a 200 is the thing that
 * makes a crawler index an error.
 *
 * <h2>No lime, and no red</h2>
 *
 * §2.4: lime means urgent and `--danger` means something failed destructively. Neither is
 * true of a mistyped URL. A failure state that shouts is a failure state that makes an
 * ordinary mistake feel like a broken platform, and docs/ui-kit.md §9.2 forbids colour from
 * carrying the meaning in any case — the heading does.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * Not because a budget forbids it but because there is nothing to reveal. An error that
 * fades in is an error that arrives after it was needed, which §5's authentication row says
 * about a wrong-password message and which is true here too.
