/**
 * What the header and the footer point at — §4.13 WS-01 and WS-02, stated once.
 *
 * <h2>It lists what exists, and nothing else</h2>
 *
 * The rule `DashboardNav` already states, and it matters more here because this is on every
 * page: an entry pointing at a 404 tells a visitor the site is broken, and one that is
 * disabled tells them it is unfinished. §4.13 names nine capabilities. About, How it works and
 * Trust and safety (WS-07) were absent until #292 built them and are in the footer now; the
 * legal pages (WS-08, #293) are still **not**, because that issue is blocked on a legal
 * deliverable §22 owns. They arrive with their pages.
 *
 * `apps/web/README.md` carries the route table this is derived from. When a route lands, it
 * is added here — one file, both surfaces, no chance of the footer knowing about a page the
 * header does not.
 *
 * <h2>Two lists, not one</h2>
 *
 * The header's is short because §8.6 gives it a 445-pixel pill to live in when collapsed;
 * the footer's is grouped because a footer is where somebody looks for the thing that was
 * not worth a slot in the header. They are separate data rather than one list with flags,
 * because "which of these is in the header" is a design decision that changes, and a flag
 * would put that decision in the wrong file.
