/**
 * The global header — §4.13 WS-01, docs/ui-kit.md §8.6, docs/motion-system.md §4.7.
 *
 * <h2>`TopBar` is finally used</h2>
 *
 * `packages/ui` has shipped `layout/TopBar` since the kit was built and nothing imported it,
 * which is issue #260's first line. It owns the collapse — the pill narrowing to 445px,
 * taking `--white-surface`, and the padding tightening, all on one 300ms curve — and this
 * component owns what goes in its three slots.
 *
 * **The header never takes a surface; the pill does.** That is §2.5 applied to navigation
 * and §8.6 states it: white is what floats above the system, and a header that took
 * `--surface-2` would read as a second page ground stacked on the first. Nothing here sets a
 * background.
 *
 * <h2>One lime element, and only when signed out</h2>
 *
 * §8.6: the header's only lime element is the primary action a signed-out visitor is being
 * asked to take, and there is at most one. That is Register. A signed-in reader is not being
 * asked to do anything, so their actions — start a campaign, notifications, the account menu
 * — are white, ghost and neutral. §2.5's last line is the reason a second lime link is not
 * available here even though there is room for one: the pill beside it is already white, and
 * lime next to it says "this is happening now" about something that is not.
 *
 * <h2>Why the navigation links are not `TopBarLink`</h2>
 *
 * `TopBarLink` renders a bare `<a>`, which is a full document load for an internal route:
 * every navigation would discard the router, refetch the shell, and re-run the session
 * bootstrap. These are `next/link` with the same treatment applied — inheriting the bar's
 * current text colour, which is what makes them legible both on the dark ground at rest and
 * on the white pill once collapsed.
 *
 * <h2>The signed-in and signed-out states, and the third one</h2>
 *
 * `SessionProvider` answers `unknown` until the bootstrap resolves, and this renders neither
 * pair while it does. Guessing would mean showing Sign in and Register to a signed-in reader
 * on every page load and then swapping them — a flash that reads as the site logging them
 * out. What holds the space is the same width as the widest of the two, so nothing moves
 * when the answer arrives, and it is `aria-hidden` because "we do not know yet" is not
 * something to announce.
 */

/**
 * The bar's own link treatment — §8.6's navigation row.
 *
 * Colour is INHERITED rather than set. `TopBar` puts `text-white` on the pill at rest and
 * `text-on-white` on it once collapsed, so a link that named its own colour would be
 * invisible in one of the two states — which is exactly the `text-white/64` failure
 * CLAUDE.md §2 warns about. Opacity carries the resting state instead, and hover restores
 * it, at 150ms: chrome that moves is chrome being noticed.
