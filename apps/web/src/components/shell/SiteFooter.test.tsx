/**
 * The global footer — §4.13 WS-02, and since #324 the first shell surface drawn from the
 * catalogue.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER:
 *
 *   - it is a labelled landmark, so it is reachable without scrolling to it.
 *   - every group in `navigation.ts` is rendered **in each of the four languages**, so a link
 *     added there cannot be silently dropped by this component and a key added there cannot
 *     ship with three languages translated.
 *   - the language line names the language being read, in itself. It was the constant
 *     `'English'` before #123, which was honest with one language and a lie at the bottom of
 *     every Russian page once there were four.
 *   - currency is STATED and not offered. #280 is blocked, and a `<select>` that changed
 *     nothing would be a control that lies — the worst of the three options available.
 *   - there is no legal column, because §22 has not written the pages and #293 is
 *     `status: needs-decision`. A Terms link resolving to a 404 is a promise about a document
 *     that does not exist.
 *   - the copyright line carries no year, because a year built from the clock differs between
 *     the server render and the browser and goes stale on a statically rendered page.
