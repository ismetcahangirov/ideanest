/**
 * The global footer — §4.13 WS-02, and since #324 the first shell surface drawn from the
 * catalogue.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER:
 *
 *   - it is a labelled landmark, so it is reachable without scrolling to it.
 *   - every group in `navigation.ts` is rendered **in each of the four languages**, so a link
 *     added there cannot be silently dropped by this component and a key added there cannot
 *     ship with three languages translated.
 *   - the language is a CONTROL, and every language in it is named in itself. It was the
 *     constant `'English'` before #123, then the endonym of the language being read, and it
 *     is four links now that a locale-prefixed URL makes switching a navigation rather than
 *     a cookie read. `LanguageSwitcher.test.tsx` covers the control itself; what is asserted
 *     here is that the footer carries it, in every language.
 *   - currency is STATED and not offered, and that is now a decision of its own rather than
 *     one shared with the language: a display currency has nothing in the URL to carry it.
 *   - there is no legal column, because §22 has not written the pages and #293 is
 *     `status: needs-decision`. A Terms link resolving to a 404 is a promise about a document
 *     that does not exist.
 *   - the copyright line carries no year, because a year built from the clock differs between
 *     the server render and the browser and goes stale on a statically rendered page.
