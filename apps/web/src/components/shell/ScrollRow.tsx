 * A sideways-scrolling `<ul>` that brings a focused item fully into view — issue #181.
 *
 * For a server component's row. A client component puts `revealFocusedItem` from
 * `@ideanest/ui` on its own row directly; `CampaignTabs` renders on the server and cannot hold
 * a handler, so it renders this instead. Only the list becomes a client boundary: its items stay server-rendered and arrive
 * as children, so the tabs are still in the HTML for a reader whose JavaScript never arrives.
