/**
 * The first focusable element in the document — §4.13 WS-01, docs/ui-kit.md §8.6.
 *
 * NOT OPTIONAL, AND PART OF THE SHELL RATHER THAN OF A PAGE. §8.6 is explicit: without one,
 * every page on the platform starts with the same dozen links for anybody navigating by
 * keyboard, and the cost is paid again on every route. It is paid once here.
 *
 * VISUALLY HIDDEN UNTIL FOCUSED, never `display: none`. A hidden element is not focusable,
 * so a skip link implemented that way is a skip link that cannot be reached by the one input
 * device it exists for. It is positioned off the top of the viewport instead and comes back
 * on focus.
 *
 * `sr-only` FROM TAILWIND IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN and is not used: it clips the element to
 * a single pixel, which is correct for text nobody sees and wrong for a control that has to
 * become visible. The pair below is the standard one — off-screen, then in place — and it
 * animates nothing. docs/motion-system.md §5 gives the shell one animation and it is the
 * header's collapse.
 *
 * The target is the `<main>` the site layout renders, which carries `tabIndex={-1}` so the
 * browser will actually move focus into it rather than only scrolling to it.
