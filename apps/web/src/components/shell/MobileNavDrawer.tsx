/**
 * Off-canvas navigation and search below the layout's breakpoint — §4.13 WS-03.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is not `Drawer`</h2>
 *
 * The kit has one, and it is behind `@ideanest/ui/motion` because it animates with `motion`.
 * This component is in the shell, which is on every route in the site, so importing it would
 * put the whole 116 kB animation runtime into the first load of every page — the regression
 * `packages/ui/src/motion.ts` exists to describe and undo. A header is the last place to
 * spend that.
 *
 * What is reused instead is everything about `Drawer` that is not the animation, from the
 * root barrel, which costs nothing: `useFocusTrap` for the tab cycle, `useDismiss` for
 * Escape, `useScrollLock` so the page behind does not scroll under the panel. Those are the
 * parts that are hard to get right and easy to get wrong.
 *
 * The entry itself is a CSS transition on `transform`, which is what §4.11.1 specifies for a
 * drawer anyway — "a drawer slides with `translate`; animating `right` or `width` relayouts
 * a fixed full-height panel on every frame" — at the 200ms that table gives, and it collapses
 * to nothing under `prefers-reduced-motion` through the global rule in the token file.
 *
 * <h2>Focus, in the order it actually happens</h2>
 *
 * Opening moves focus into the panel and closing returns it to the button that opened it. A
 * drawer that leaves focus behind on the page is a drawer a keyboard user cannot reach and
 * then cannot escape from; one that drops focus to `<body>` on close puts them back at the
 * top of the document, which is worse than where they started.
 *
 * <h2>It exists in the DOM only while it is open</h2>
 *
 * Not hidden with a class. Every link inside it is a tab stop, and a permanently mounted
 * panel with `opacity: 0` would put nine of them in the tab order of every page on the site
 * for anybody who never opens it.
