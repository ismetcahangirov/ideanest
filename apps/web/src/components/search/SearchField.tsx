/**
 * The search entry — §4.13 WS-01's field in the header, WS-03's in the drawer, and the one at
 * the top of WS-06's results page.
 *
 * <h2>A form that navigates, not a combobox</h2>
 *
 * `/discover` already has a combobox with live suggestions (`SearchBox`, issue #46) and this
 * is deliberately not a second one. Three reasons, and the third is what settles it:
 *
 *   1. **It is on every page.** A suggestion request per keystroke, from the header, on every
 *      route in the application, is a load profile nobody asked for — and `SearchController`
 *      rate-limits suggestions separately for exactly that reason.
 *   2. **The popup would open over page content.** In the header it would cover whatever the
 *      reader is looking at, at the top of every screen, and §8.6's rule is that chrome does
 *      not compete with content.
 *   3. **It costs nothing to type and press Enter.** The refinement surface is one navigation
 *      away and is better at refining than a 240-pixel box in a header.
 *
 * So this is a plain form: type, submit, land on `/search?q=…` with the results already in
 * the HTML. The rich version stays on discovery, where a reader is refining rather than
 * starting.
 *
 * <h2>Motion</h2>
 *
 * None. The shell's budget is §4.7's collapse and nothing else, and docs/motion-system.md
 * §5.1 gives a search box "none — the popup appears and disappears" even on the surface that
 * has one. What changes on focus is a border colour, at 150ms.
