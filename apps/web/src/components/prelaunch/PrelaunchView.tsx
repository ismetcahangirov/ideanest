/**
 * A campaign's public pre-launch page: what is coming, and the one control that
 * asks to be told when it opens.
 *
 * NO SESSION IS REQUIRED, and that is the feature rather than a detail. The
 * people a pre-launch page exists to collect are people who have never heard of
 * the platform; a form behind a sign-in wall collects nobody. The address is
 * typed and the server stores it (docs/architecture.md §17.4 decided the shape),
 * so this page never asks anybody to register.
 *
 * WHEN THERE *IS* A SESSION the address field disappears and the reminder is
 * registered against the account. That is not a guess about the visitor: it is
 * exactly what `publicFetch` will do with the request, so the form is showing
 * what is about to happen rather than offering a field the server would ignore.
 *
 * MOTION: one `FadeUp`, once, on the page's own content — the only scroll-entry
 * animation the system has (docs/motion-system.md §4.1), transform and opacity
 * only, and static under `prefers-reduced-motion` because `FadeUp` renders
 * without the transform when the query matches. Nothing else on this page moves:
 * the follower count is a number that changes, per §6's rule for countdowns, and
 * the submit control shows a word rather than a spinner.
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY: a real `<form>` with a real `<label>`, a submit button rather
 * than a click handler on a `div`, one live region for the failure and one for
 * the success, and a confirmed state that says plainly that the visitor is on
 * the list and will be written to once.

          THE FORM IS OUTSIDE IT, for two reasons. The motion budget is the
          smaller one: §5's rule is that motion decreases as the user gets closer
          to acting, and the signup is the action. The larger one is mechanical —
          `FadeUp` calls `motion.create()` during render, which produces a new
          component type on every render, and React unmounts and remounts
          everything underneath it. A controlled input inside would lose its focus
          and its value on the first keystroke. Worth fixing in the design system;
          not worth working around here by animating a form that should not
          animate anyway.
