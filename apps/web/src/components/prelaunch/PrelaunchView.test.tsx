/**
 * The public pre-launch page. Appearance is reviewed in Storybook; these cover
 * what fails silently.
 *
 * The three that carry the design are the ones about the signup: a real labelled
 * field rather than a placeholder standing in for a label, a refusal that is
 * ANNOUNCED rather than only coloured, and a confirmed state that replaces the
 * form instead of leaving a button somebody presses twice. The remaining tests
 * are about the two refusals this page is most likely to meet in the wild — a
 * campaign that never opened a page, and one that opened while the visitor was
 * reading it.
