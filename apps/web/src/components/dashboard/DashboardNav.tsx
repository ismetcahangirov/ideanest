/**
 * The way between the dashboard's panels.
 *
 * <h2>It lists what exists, and nothing else</h2>
 *
 * §4.7 describes nineteen capabilities and this shell has five panels: the overview
 * (CD-01, #93), the charts (CD-02, CD-07 and CD-08, #96), the backers (CD-10 and CD-11,
 * #97 and #79), the financial summary (CD-16, #99), and §4.8's surveys (PM-01 to PM-04,
 * #73). This paragraph used to record that the fifth was missing, because an entry that was
 * disabled, or pointing at a 404, would tell a creator the dashboard is unfinished — which is
 * the one thing a shell exists to avoid saying. It is built, so it is here.
 *
 * <p>The order is the order a creator reads them in: what the campaign has raised, then
 * how it raised it, then who the people are, then what they were actually paid, then what
 * those people still have to tell them. Not the order the issues landed in — and surveys go
 * last for a reason of their own, since §4.8 begins when funding closes and everything above
 * it does not.
 *
 * <p>The money sits after the people rather than beside "Overview", and that is deliberate:
 * the overview's "raised" is what backers pledged, and this panel's "net" is what reaches a
 * bank account. Two figures about the same campaign that differ by the fees, adjacent in a
 * navigation bar, is an invitation to read one as a correction of the other.
 *
 * <h2>A client component for one reason</h2>
 *
 * `usePathname`, to mark the current panel. That is the whole of it: no fetch, no state,
 * no effect. When the second entry lands this is where "which one am I on" is already
 * answered.
 *
 * <h2>Accessibility</h2>
 *
 * `aria-current="page"` carries the selection, not the colour. docs/ui-kit.md §9.2:
 * colour alone never carries meaning, and "which page am I on" is meaning. The underline
 * is a second, visual signal for the same fact.
