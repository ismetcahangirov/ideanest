/**
 * The way between the dashboard's panels.
 *
 * <h2>It lists what exists, and nothing else</h2>
 *
 * §4.7 describes nineteen capabilities and this shell has five panels: the overview
 * (CD-01, #93), the charts (CD-02, CD-07 and CD-08, #96), the backers (CD-10 and CD-11,
 * #97 and #79), the financial summary (CD-16, #99), and §4.8's surveys (PM-01 to PM-04,
 * #73). This paragraph used to record that the fifth was missing, because an entry that was
 * disabled, or pointing at a 404, would tell a creator the dashboard is unfinished — which is
 * the one thing a shell exists to avoid saying. It is built, so it is here.
 *
 * <p>The order is the order a creator reads them in: what the campaign has raised, then
 * how it raised it, then who the people are, then what they were actually paid, then what
 * those people still have to tell them. Not the order the issues landed in — and surveys go
 * last for a reason of their own, since §4.8 begins when funding closes and everything above
 * it does not.
 *
 * <p>The money sits after the people rather than beside "Overview", and that is deliberate:
 * the overview's "raised" is what backers pledged, and this panel's "net" is what reaches a
 * bank account. Two figures about the same campaign that differ by the fees, adjacent in a
 * navigation bar, is an invitation to read one as a correction of the other.
 *
 * <h2>A client component for one reason</h2>
 *
 * `usePathname`, to mark the current panel, and the one effect that follows from it below.
 * No fetch, no state.
 *
 * <h2>One row that scrolls sideways on a phone — #136</h2>
 *
 * Five labels do not fit across a phone: in Russian they are about 470px of tabs against the
 * 280px a 320px screen leaves inside the page gutter, and the row used to neither wrap nor
 * scroll, so the last tabs were pushed off the screen and the page itself scrolled sideways.
 * The row now scrolls on its own axis, which is what the account and admin navigation already
 * do below their breakpoint (`AccountNav`, `AdminNav`) and what the campaign page's tab strip
 * does (`CampaignTabs`) — one pattern, not a select on one screen and a scroller on another.
 * No label wraps (`whitespace-nowrap`), and a second row is not an option either: it would
 * push the panel down on exactly the viewports where height is scarcest.
 *
 * Scrolling hides something, so the current tab is brought into view when the panel loads:
 * "Surveys" is last, and a creator who opened it from an email would otherwise land on a row
 * that shows four other tabs and not the one they are on. Only the row scrolls, never the page
 * — `scrollIntoView` would also move the window vertically to satisfy its own alignment — and
 * it jumps rather than glides, because docs/motion-system.md §5 gives a working surface no
 * motion to spend on it.
 *
 * A scroll container clips whatever overflows it, and the focus ring is drawn outside the tab:
 * two pixels wide, two pixels off (the kit's `:focus-visible` rule in `theme.css`, which is
 * unlayered and so outranks any offset utility put on the link). So the row carries four
 * pixels of padding on every side and gives them back with a negative margin, the way
 * `AccountNav` makes room for the same ring — nothing moves, and ui-kit §9.3's ring is whole
 * rather than cut off at the top, the bottom and the row's edges. Tab still reaches every
 * entry, and the row scrolls each one fully into view as it takes focus: Chromium leaves a tab
 * that is only partly off the edge where it is, so `revealFocusedItem` from `@ideanest/ui`
 * asks for it (#181) — instantly, like the load-time reveal below.
 *
 * <h2>Accessibility</h2>
 *
 * `aria-current="page"` carries the selection, not the colour. docs/ui-kit.md §9.2:
 * colour alone never carries meaning, and "which page am I on" is meaning. The underline
 * is a second, visual signal for the same fact.
