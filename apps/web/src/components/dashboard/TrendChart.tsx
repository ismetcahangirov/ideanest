/**
 * §4.7's CD-02: what the campaign has raised, over the days it has been running.
 *
 * <h2>The line is the running total, not the day's takings</h2>
 *
 * Both are in the data and only one of them answers the question a creator opens this panel
 * with, which is "are we going to make it". A per-day bar chart of a campaign's takings is
 * mostly noise — funding is famously front-and-back loaded — and the shape that matters is
 * the one climbing towards the goal. The daily figures are in the table below the chart,
 * where somebody asking a different question can read them.
 *
 * <h2>The series is sparse, and the x-axis is time rather than position</h2>
 *
 * A day on which nothing was pledged has no entry (the rollup does not write zero rows, and
 * V27 says why). Plotting points at equal spacing would compress a quiet fortnight into the
 * same width as a busy one and quietly redraw the campaign's history. Each point is placed
 * by <em>which day it is</em> inside the requested range, so a gap is a gap.
 *
 * <h2>A picture and a table, not a picture with a table hidden behind it</h2>
 *
 * The `<svg>` is `aria-hidden` and the same numbers are a real `<table>` underneath, folded
 * into a `<details>`. Nothing is encoded in colour, so the chart survives forced colours and
 * a printout; the table is what a screen reader reads, and it is the same data rather than a
 * summary of it.
 *
 * <h2>No draw-in</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 sanctions a chart draw-in on the dashboard, and this spends none
 * of it. A stroke that animates in delays the one thing the panel exists to show, and the
 * budget is a ceiling rather than a target. Nothing here animates, so nothing here needs a
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` branch.
