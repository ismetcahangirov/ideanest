/**
 * §4.7's CD-16 — the creator's financial summary. Issue #99.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER, and every one of them is a statement about somebody's money that a
 * screenshot cannot check:
 *
 *   - **the whole breakdown is on screen, not the net.** A creator looking at this is asking
 *     "why was I paid this", which is five questions; a single figure with a note saying
 *     "fees deducted" is not something anybody can check.
 *   - **projected and settled are never rendered identically.** Before a payout exists the
 *     fees are what today's schedule would charge; afterwards they are what it was priced at.
 *     A panel that said the same thing for both would be lying on one of the two days it
 *     matters.
 *   - **a zero for tax says which kind of zero it is.** A bare "− AZN 0.00" reads as "no tax
 *     is due on your earnings", which is not something this platform is in a position to say.
 *   - **books that do not balance are said out loud**, to somebody who can act on it. A
 *     posting that does not balance is refused by a database trigger, so it can only appear
 *     for a row that arrived past both the application and the trigger.
 *   - **a refusal reads as something a creator can act on** rather than as a status code, and
 *     a 403 says which grant is missing.
