/**
 * "Time remaining" — the last quarter of §4.7's CD-01.
 *
 * <h2>It counts down against the service's clock, not the reader's</h2>
 *
 * The service sends `deadline` and `serverTime` and no `secondsRemaining`, because a
 * remainder computed there is wrong the moment it is sent. This measures the difference
 * between `serverTime` and the browser's clock once, when the response arrives, and
 * subtracts it from every tick afterwards — so a creator whose machine is forty minutes
 * fast is told the truth rather than being told it forty minutes early.
 *
 * <h2>It ticks at the resolution it displays</h2>
 *
 * Three weeks out it re-renders once a minute and shows days; in the last hour it
 * re-renders once a second and shows seconds. A component showing "27 days left" that
 * woke the main thread every second would change nothing 86,400 times a day, on a screen
 * creators leave open — and docs/motion-system.md's objection to a permanent animation is
 * about exactly that.
 *
 * <h2>Colour</h2>
 *
 * Lime is urgency and nothing else (ui-kit §2.4). Inside 48 hours the clock is a lime
 * surface with near-black text on it; outside, it is ordinary text. It is never lime
 * *text* — that measures 1.3:1. And the urgency is stated in words as well as in colour,
 * because colour alone carries nothing to a reader who cannot see it (§9.2).
