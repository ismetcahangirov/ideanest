/**
 * §4.7's CD-01: raised, backers, completion, and time remaining.
 *
 * <h2>Why the numbers are fetched here rather than server-rendered</h2>
 *
 * #119 put the public campaign page's content in the first byte of HTML, and this screen
 * deliberately does not follow it. That page is anonymous, cacheable and written for a
 * crawler; this one is one creator's view of their own money behind a bearer token, and
 * the service answers it `no-store`. `lib/api/server.ts` sends no token by design, so
 * there is nothing to render on the server.
 *
 * <h2>Colour carries two different facts and must not confuse them</h2>
 *
 * `--success` means the goal was reached. Lime means act now. docs/ui-kit.md is explicit
 * that conflating them tells a creator the opposite of the truth, so the progress bar and
 * the funded badge use success, the clock uses lime and only inside 48 hours, and neither
 * borrows the other's token. Both are also stated in words.
 *
 * <h2>No entry animation</h2>
 *
 * `FadeUp` lives behind `@ideanest/ui/motion` and brings 116 kB of animation runtime with
 * it. Spending that on a panel whose numbers change while you watch them is the wrong
 * trade, and docs/motion-system.md §5 puts the smallest motion budget on the surfaces
 * closest to money. This is one of them.
