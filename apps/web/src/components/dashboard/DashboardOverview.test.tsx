 *
 * Rendered rather than screenshotted, because every assertion here is about a statement
 * concerning money or urgency that a picture cannot check:
 *
 *   - the figures are the campaign's, formatted from the exact strings the API sent;
 *   - a campaign at 99.99% has not reached its goal, and the screen must not imply it has;
 *   - a campaign with no goal gets no progress bar, rather than one at zero;
 *   - a closed campaign shows what it raised at the deadline beside the live total —
 *     #63's rule, and the pair a creator would otherwise misread;
 *   - a refusal reads as something the creator can act on rather than as a status code.
