/**
 * A magnitude-by-identity chart: one horizontal bar per thing, longest first.
 *
 * <h2>Why bars, and why horizontal</h2>
 *
 * The question both of these answer — which tier sold, where the backers are — is
 * *magnitude compared across a handful of named things*, which is the one job a bar chart
 * does better than anything else. A pie was the obvious alternative and is worse for the
 * same reason it always is: comparing angles is harder than comparing lengths, and the
 * labels have nowhere to go. Horizontal because the labels are words of unpredictable
 * length — "An early copy, signed" does not fit under a vertical bar at any width a
 * dashboard has.
 *
 * <h2>It is a table, and that is not a compromise</h2>
 *
 * Every row carries its own label and its own value as text, so the chart and the data
 * behind it are one thing rather than a picture with a table hidden underneath it. Nothing
 * here is encoded in colour alone (ui-kit §9.2): the bar is redundant with the number
 * beside it, which is what makes the whole thing legible to a screen reader, in forced
 * colours, and in a printout.
 *
 * <h2>One colour</h2>
 *
 * A single series does not need a palette, and this system has no data-visualisation ramp
 * to take one from. White is the accent for a neutral quantity here — lime would say
 * "urgent" and `--success` would say "the goal was reached", and a tier selling well is
 * neither. `--surface-3` is the track behind it.
 *
 * <h2>No entry animation</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 allows the dashboard a chart draw-in and this spends none of
 * it: the widths come from data that is already on screen, and a bar that grows on mount
 * delays the only thing a creator opened the panel to read.
