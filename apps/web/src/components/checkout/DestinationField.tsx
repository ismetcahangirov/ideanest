/**
 * PL-05: where the pledge is going, and only when something in it is posted.
 *
 * <h2>The control is absent, not disabled, for a digital pledge</h2>
 *
 * `useCheckout` renders this only when the selection contains a `DOMESTIC` or
 * `INTERNATIONAL` line. Asking a backer for a country in order to deliver a
 * download is asking for information the campaign has no reason to hold (§17.4),
 * and it is the visible half of a shipping model that has not understood what it
 * is charging for.
 *
 * <h2>Country names come from `Intl`, not from a table in this repository</h2>
 *
 * `Intl.DisplayNames` already holds every ISO 3166-1 region name, in both
 * languages the product ships in (§21.1), maintained by the platform. A checked-in
 * list of two hundred names would be a second copy to keep current, would be
 * English-only, and would be wrong the next time a country renames itself. The
 * code is shown when the runtime has no name for it, which is the honest fallback
 * — a destination the creator priced is one the backer can still choose.
 *
 * <h2>What is offered, and what is refused</h2>
 *
 * The options are the union of every destination the selected shipping lines
 * price. A country priced for the reward but not for an add-on is therefore
 * offered and then refused, by name, with the line that refuses it — see
 * `unpricedLines`. That is deliberate: silently omitting it would leave somebody
 * hunting for a destination the campaign page told them existed.
