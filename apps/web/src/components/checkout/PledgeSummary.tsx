/**
 * PL-06: what this pledge comes to, broken into its lines, always on screen.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is the white surface</h2>
 *
 * docs/ui-kit.md §8.5 makes checkout "the one screen where a white surface
 * dominates": somebody about to part with money wants maximum clarity and a
 * familiar context, and near-black on white gives both. It is the SUMMARY that
 * takes it rather than the whole page, for a reason the system itself decides —
 * every form primitive in `@ideanest/ui` is built for the dark ground (a `Radio`
 * label is `text-white`, an input is `--surface-3`), so putting the controls on
 * white would mean reimplementing them, which CLAUDE.md §2 rules out and §7.13
 * gives no white variants for. §8.3 already sends "financial summary" to the
 * floating panel, so this is the shape the system had in mind.
 *
 * Text inside is near-black, so `--text-secondary` does not apply here (§7.9).
 * Every muted tone is `text-on-white` at reduced opacity.
 *
 * <h2>Two sources, one renderer</h2>
 *
 * The panel takes `PledgeAmounts` and does not know whether it is showing the
 * client's preview or the server's quote. That is the point: a preview drawn
 * differently from the real thing would read as two different numbers, and the
 * one thing this panel must never do is make a backer wonder which figure is the
 * one that counts. What changes with the source is a sentence, not the money.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * The total changes as the selection changes and it changes without a transition.
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 puts checkout at "near zero — 150ms step change and a
 * loading indicator", and a number that eases into place on the screen where
 * somebody is deciding whether to pay reads as hesitation about the amount.

   * campaign's own currency and were shown no approximation. It is also what a deployment
   * with no rate source answers, and what a pledge confirmed before the rate existed
   * carries. All three draw nothing.
   *
   * <p>It is handed down rather than computed here, because the two callers get it from
   * different places and neither of them is this component's business: the pledge screen
   * reads the rate the service <em>stored on the pledge</em>, which is the figure that backer
   * was actually quoted, and a checkout would read today's.
