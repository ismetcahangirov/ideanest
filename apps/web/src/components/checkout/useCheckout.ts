/**
 * The checkout, as one hook: what the backer chose, what it costs, and the two
 * requests that turn it into a pledge.
 *
 * <h2>The state lives here and not in the URL</h2>
 *
 * `DiscoveryView` puts every filter in the query string, because a filtered feed
 * is a thing to link to and to come back to. A checkout is the opposite on both
 * counts. A half-made pledge is not shareable — the link would carry another
 * person's selection to somebody who cannot pay for it — and the back button must
 * not be able to re-enter a reservation that has since expired or been confirmed.
 * So the selection is React state, and the steps are steps rather than routes.
 *
 * The route carries two query parameters and neither is a selection: PL-15's
 * `?token=`, and `?reward=`, which names a tier the campaign page already
 * printed. It seeds step one and reserves nothing — the effect beside
 * `chooseReward` sets out what happens when it names a tier that has gone.
 *
 * <h2>Two amounts, and only one of them is true</h2>
 *
 * `quote` is the client's preview, recomputed on every keystroke so the total
 * moves with the choice. `pledge.amounts` is the server's, and from the moment a
 * draft comes back it is the only thing shown. See `lib/pledges/quote.ts` for why
 * that is not politeness about layering: the client is pricing from a list it
 * fetched some seconds ago, and the server prices the row it is reserving inside
 * the transaction that reserves it.
 *
 * <h2>Idempotency</h2>
 *
 * One `IdempotencyKeyring` per checkout, held in a ref so it survives every
 * re-render and none of the remounts that mean somebody started over. Keys are
 * issued per request body, so pressing "Reserve" twice after a dropped connection
 * sends the same key and gets the same pledge back. `lib/pledges/idempotency.ts`
 * carries the full argument, including the one case where a key must be retired:
 * a reservation that expired is a new intent, not a retry, and replaying its key
 * would hand back the draft that just expired.
 *
 * <h2>The one refusal this hook answers by itself</h2>
 *
 * `IDEMPOTENT_REQUEST_IN_PROGRESS` is what a double-click produces: the first
 * request still holds the claim on the key, and the second is told to ask again
 * in a moment. It is not a state a backer can do anything about — their pledge
 * is being made, exactly once, by the attempt that got there first — so it is
 * waited out here rather than shown. `attemptWithRetry` below does the waiting,
 * with the SAME key — which is what the keyring makes possible: the key belongs
 * to the intent, the intent has not changed, and nothing is retired between
 * tries.
