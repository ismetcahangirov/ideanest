/**
 * §21.2's approximation, as the checkout panel draws it — issue #327.
 *
 * <p>The panel had no test of its own: it is a presentational component whose lines are
 * covered through `CheckoutView`. What #327 adds to it is the one thing on this platform
 * that must never be mistaken for a price, so it gets assertions of its own:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the chargeable total is always there and always unqualified;
 *   <li>the approximation is marked as one, in a character rather than a word — and named
 *       in words for a screen reader, which would announce `≈` as nothing at all;
 *   <li>nothing is drawn when there is no approximation, which is the ordinary case.
 * </ul>
