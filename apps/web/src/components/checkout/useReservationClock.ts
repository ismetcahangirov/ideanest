/**
 * How long the stock is held for — PL-13's five minutes, counted down.
 *
 * <h2>It does not animate, and that is a rule rather than a preference</h2>
 *
 * `docs/motion-system.md` §6 is explicit: "The countdown must not animate. The
 * number simply changes." A per-second animation means the page never settles and
 * the battery never rests, and checkout's budget (§5) is "near zero" before any
 * of that is considered. So this is a `setInterval` that writes a number, and the
 * component that renders it applies no transition to it.
 *
 * <h2>The ticking value is not announced</h2>
 *
 * The label is ordinary text, deliberately outside any live region. A polite
 * region that updated every second would talk over everything else on the page,
 * and an assertive one would make the screen unusable. A screen-reader user reads
 * the remaining time when they reach it, exactly as a sighted user reads it when
 * they look at it; what IS announced is the expiry, once, by the alert that
 * replaces it — the same division `CharacterCount` makes in docs/ui-kit.md §7.13.
