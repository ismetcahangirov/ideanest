/**
 * The frame the three static content pages share — §4.13 WS-07, issue #292.
 *
 * <h2>One measure, and it is narrower than the site's</h2>
 *
 * `SiteShell` gives every page 1400 pixels. That is right for a grid of campaign cards and
 * wrong for prose: docs/ui-kit.md §5.4 puts long-form text at a measure a reader's eye can
 * return along, which is roughly 68 characters. The column here is 62ch and the page's own
 * padding does the rest.
 *
 * <h2>`--surface-2` and `--text-reading`, not white on the page ground</h2>
 *
 * §9.2's last prohibition: "set long-form white on pure black" — do not. These are the only
 * pages on the platform with several hundred words of continuous text, so they are the only
 * ones the rule is actually about. The body takes the reading colour and the panel takes the
 * raised surface.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none, and that is a budget decision rather than a taste one</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 gives the marketing home **Full**, and it would be defensible to
 * read these three as marketing. `FadeUp` lives behind `@ideanest/ui/motion`, which is 116 kB
 * of animation runtime, and three routes whose entire content is text would each pay it to
 * animate a heading. `packages/ui/README.md` has the measurement; the home page is where that
 * cost buys something.
