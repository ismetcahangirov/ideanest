/**
 * One version of one of §22.2's documents, rendered — issue #439.
 *
 * <h2>The version and the effective date are on the page, not in the metadata</h2>
 *
 * #439 asks for both to be *visible*, and that is a stronger requirement than it sounds. A
 * legal document without a version is a document nobody can refer to: an acceptance record
 * names a number, and a reader who cannot see the number on the page cannot check that the two
 * agree. The effective date is the second half — "since when does this bind me" is the question
 * a person has when they arrive here already worried.
 *
 * <h2>The content hash is printed too</h2>
 *
 * It looks like plumbing and it is the opposite. V65 stores the SHA-256 of the body beside the
 * body, and #429 has SİMA sign that hash — so a creator who signed version 4 of the creator
 * agreement can check the digest on this page against the one on their signature and establish,
 * without trusting the platform, that this is the text they signed. Hiding it would remove the
 * only thing that makes the signature checkable by the person who made it.
 *
 * <h2>The language a reader got, when it is not the one they asked for</h2>
 *
 * `LegalDocuments.inForce` falls back to the governing Azerbaijani text rather than answering
 * 404, and this page says so when it happens. The alternative was tried and rejected in the
 * service: a reader shown a blank page has been told nothing, and a reader shown the governing
 * text without being told which language it is in has been told something confusing about a
 * document that binds them.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing published is a state, not an error</h2>
 *
 * §22.2 requires the platform to *have* eight documents. This repository has the machinery and
 * none of the words — they are #423's adviser's — so a document with no published version says
 * so plainly. Not a 404, because the address is real and permanent and a 404 tells a crawler to
 * stop asking; not an error page, because nothing went wrong.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none. No client island. No cookie.</h2>
 *
 * This component is why the route stays static. It reads no cookie, opens no context provider
 * and imports nothing from the `@ideanest/ui` barrel — `packages/ui/src/server.ts` records that
 * the barrel pulls `createContext` into the server graph and fails `next build` naming a
 * component the page never used. `StaticPage` and `Link` are the whole of its dependencies.
