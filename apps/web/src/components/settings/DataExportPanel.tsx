/**
 * §4.1's A-11 — a machine-readable copy of the account. Issue #279.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a button and not a link</h2>
 *
 * `<a href="/v1/me/export" download>` is the obvious shape and it does not work here. The
 * access token lives in a module variable and travels as an `Authorization` header;
 * a navigation the browser makes on its own carries no header, so the link would fetch a 401
 * and the browser would download the problem document. The bytes are fetched with the session
 * and handed to the browser afterwards.
 *
 * <h2>The object URL is revoked, and not on a timer</h2>
 *
 * A `blob:` URL keeps the whole export alive in memory until it is revoked, and the export is
 * everything the platform holds about a person. It is revoked in the same task, immediately
 * after the click is dispatched — every browser that supports `download` has already taken its
 * own reference by then, and a `setTimeout` would be a guess about how long that takes.
 *
 * <h2>The rate limit is surfaced rather than retried</h2>
 *
 * §17.4 calls this "the single most valuable request an attacker with a stolen access token
 * can make" and bounds it per account. A client that retried on a 429 would be spending
 * somebody else's allowance on their behalf.
