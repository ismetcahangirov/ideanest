/**
 * §4.2's P-10, language half — issue #280.
 *
 * <h2>The endonyms are the whole accessibility argument for this screen</h2>
 *
 * Every option is named in its own language, from `LOCALE_NAMES`, and never translated into
 * the language the page happens to be drawn in. This screen's one hard case is somebody who
 * landed in a language they cannot read — a shared machine, a mistaken tap, an account
 * created for them by somebody else — and "Azerbaijani" spelled in Russian is unreadable to
 * exactly that person. `Азербайджанский` is a dead end; `Azərbaycan dili` is a way out.
 *
 * Each option also carries its own `lang`, so a screen reader pronounces `Русский` with
 * Russian phonemes rather than reading it as mangled English. `lang` is valid on any element
 * and overrides for its subtree, which is the standard mechanism for a list that is
 * deliberately in four languages at once.
 *
 * <h2>The control is a native `<select>`</h2>
 *
 * docs/ui-kit.md §7.13 — "the native `<select>` is a decision, not a shortcut". Four fixed
 * options is precisely the case it names: a hand-built listbox would owe type-ahead, Home/End,
 * PageUp/PageDown, the announcement contract and the platform wheel picker on iOS and Android,
 * and it is the type-ahead that matters most here — somebody looking for their own language
 * types the first letter of a word they recognise.
 *
 * `Field` wraps it so the label, the hint, `aria-describedby` and `aria-invalid` come from the
 * primitive rather than from four attributes somebody has to remember. §7.13: "a hint the
 * assistive layer never reaches is decoration".
 *
 * <h2>Saving writes twice, deliberately</h2>
 *
 * `PATCH /v1/me/locale` is the durable record — it is the language the service composes mail
 * in, which `LocalePreferenceController` explains has never been choosable until now. The
 * cookie is what a **render** reads, because a server render must not wait on an API call to
 * know which catalogue to load (`src/i18n/request.ts`). Writing only the account would leave
 * this very page in the old language until something else happened to set the cookie; writing
 * only the cookie would leave the account's mail in a language nobody chose.
 *
 * `router.refresh()` then re-renders the server tree, which re-reads the cookie through
 * `src/i18n/request.ts` and redraws the account area in the language just chosen. It comes
 * after the cookie write for that reason and would be a no-op before it.
 *
 * <h2>What this deliberately does not do: re-read `GET /v1/me`</h2>
 *
 * Nothing in the client reads `session.locale` except the mirror in `SessionProvider`, whose
 * only job is to make the cookie agree with the account — which this panel has just done
 * directly, and from the authoritative direction. Spending a round trip to be told the value
 * we just wrote would be a request that can only confirm what we already know.
 *
 * <h2>The call is inline rather than in a `lib/` module</h2>
 *
 * One endpoint, one field, no response body to shape and no refusal to branch on: the service
 * validates the four tags before the handler runs and answers 204 or 400, so a wrapper would
 * be a re-export of `authorizedFetch` with a longer name. The panels that do have a module
 * behind them — `lib/auth/credentials.ts`, `lib/account/closure.ts` — have one because they
 * translate several problem codes into several field errors.
 *
 * <h2>Success and failure are text plus an icon, never a colour</h2>
 *
 * docs/ui-kit.md §9.2. `InlineAlert` pairs each variant with its own icon, so the message
 * still reads for somebody with a colour-vision deficiency, in a high-contrast mode, or on a
 * printout. Success is `--success` with `CircleCheck` and **never lime** — lime says "act
 * now", and a saved preference is the opposite of an outstanding task (§8.1). The failure is
 * `--danger` with `CircleAlert` and a sentence that says what to do about it.
 *
 * The success message sits inside a permanent polite live region rather than appearing as new
 * content, because a region that is created at the same moment it is filled is one many screen
 * readers never announce. The failure carries `role="alert"` from `InlineAlert` itself.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 — "authentication, account settings: none — 150ms colour on
 * controls". The 150ms belongs to the input skin and the button, and this file adds no entry
 * animation, no transition and no `FadeUp`.

        THE CURRENCY IS STATED, NOT OFFERED, AND THAT IS THE HONEST HALF OF #280.

        §21.2 describes a display currency as an approximation converted from central-bank
        rates. The service has no rate source, no rate table and no second currency: three of
        its services — `ReservationService`, `ProjectEditingService` and `RewardService` —
        each pin `SUPPORTED_CURRENCY = "AZN"`, and the last two refuse a goal or a reward
        price stated in anything else. A selector here would offer to convert manat into
        manat.

        The three ways to build it were: a control with one option, which is a control that
        cannot be used; a control with several options and a rate somebody invented, which
        would put a wrong number next to somebody's pledge and is the failure CLAUDE.md's money
        rule exists to prevent; or a sentence. This is the sentence. `SiteFooter` states the
        same fact in the same words for the same reason, and it becomes a control on the day
        there is a rate source and a second currency to convert into.
