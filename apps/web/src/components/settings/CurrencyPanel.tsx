/**
 * §4.2's P-10, the currency half — issue #327.
 *
 * <h2>THIS USED TO BE A SENTENCE, AND THE SENTENCE WAS RIGHT AT THE TIME</h2>
 *
 * `LanguagePanel` carried three lines of copy stating the currency as a fact, with an
 * argument beside them: §21.2 describes a display currency converted from central-bank
 * rates, the service had no rate source, no rate table and no second currency, and "a
 * selector here would offer to convert manat into manat". #280 chose the sentence over a
 * control with one option or a control with an invented rate, and it chose correctly.
 *
 * #327 built the rate source. What made the sentence right was the absence of a rate rather
 * than the absence of a second <em>project</em> currency — the campaign is still funded in
 * manat and always will be under phase 1, and this control does not change that. A backer in
 * Istanbul reading a manat campaign wants to know roughly what it costs in lira, and that is
 * now answerable with a real rate from a real central bank.
 *
 * <h2>The options come from the SERVICE, not from a list in this repository</h2>
 *
 * Which currencies are available is a property of what the central bank published and when
 * the platform last reached it — so a currency offered last week is not offered this week if
 * the source stopped publishing it. `page.tsx` reads `/v1/exchange-rates` on the server (it
 * is public and cacheable, so this costs no round trip after hydration) and hands the list
 * down. A hard-coded list here would be a second copy of the truth, wrong on exactly the day
 * it matters.
 *
 * <h2>When the platform can offer nothing, this is a sentence again</h2>
 *
 * A deployment with the feature switched off, or one whose source has been unreachable past
 * its limit, has one currency to offer and it is the one every amount is already in. The
 * panel says so rather than drawing a `<select>` with a single option — which is a control
 * that cannot be used, the exact thing #280 refused.
 *
 * <h2>It says what a display currency IS, every time</h2>
 *
 * §21.2: the figure is an approximation and collection occurs in the project's currency. A
 * backer who believed otherwise would be one who thinks they are being charged in dollars,
 * and would find out from their card statement. The hint under the control is not decoration.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * `docs/motion-system.md` §5 — "authentication, account settings: none". The 150ms belongs to
 * the input skin and the button; this file adds no entry animation and no `FadeUp`.
