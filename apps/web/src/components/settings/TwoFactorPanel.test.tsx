/**
 * §4.1's A-07 — issue #278.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER:
 *
 *   - **enrolling is not enabling.** The screen says two-factor is not on until a code is
 *     entered, because `TwoFactorEnrolmentService` makes that the property that stops a phone
 *     dying mid-flow from becoming a lockout. A screen that congratulated somebody after
 *     `enable` would be lying about the state of their account.
 *   - **the recovery codes cannot be clicked past.** There is no re-issue endpoint, so the
 *     acknowledgement gates the only way off that step.
 *   - the "already enabled" refusal moves the panel to the off-path rather than being printed
 *     as an error. It is the answer to the question this screen cannot ask — `GET /v1/me`
 *     carries no `twoFactorEnabled`.
 *   - disabling costs the password and a proof, because otherwise the whole feature is worth
 *     exactly one password.
 *   - **the step's heading has focus before control comes back.** #322: the move used to be
 *     scheduled for the next frame, which is after the browser has already delivered the next
 *     keystroke, so a reader who typed straight away lost everything past the first character
 *     to the heading. The test below pins the timing rather than the symptom, because the
 *     symptom only appears on a machine slow enough to lose the race.
