/**
 * §4.1's A-12 — moving the account to another email address. Issue #277.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing changes when this succeeds, and the screen has to be built around that</h2>
 *
 * `POST /v1/auth/change-email` answers **202, not 204**, and `CredentialController` says the
 * difference is the point: `users.email` moves when the new address follows its link, and until
 * then the old address still signs in, still receives, and still resets. V44 carries the
 * reasoning — writing the address immediately means one typo puts the account behind a mailbox
 * nobody can read, and both sign-in and the reset that would fix it go to the address on the
 * account.
 *
 * **So the confirmation below says what was sent, never what was changed**, and it keeps saying
 * which address is still the account's. The tempting version — "Your email address is now
 * new@example.com" — is false for as long as the link is unopened, which may be for ever, and
 * the person it is false to is the one who can no longer find their account.
 *
 * There is nothing to re-read afterwards either. `GET /v1/me` still answers the old address,
 * because the old address is still the answer, so this panel does not call `refresh()` to
 * discover a fact it already knows.
 *
 * <h2>Both addresses are written to, and only one of them can act</h2>
 *
 * The new address gets the link. The old one gets a notice with **no link at all**: it cannot
 * approve the change and does not need to. What it is for is that somebody losing their account
 * finds out at the address they still hold, while they still hold it. A-12's own wording is
 * "confirmation to both addresses", and the screen says which message goes where rather than
 * leaving somebody to wonder why two arrived.
 *
 * <h2>An address change revokes nothing</h2>
 *
 * Unlike A-13. Nothing about the credential changed and the sessions were issued to the same
 * person, so this form does not warn about a sign-out and must not: a warning about a
 * consequence that does not happen is the same defect as silence about one that does.
 *
 * <h2>The two refusals go under the field each is about</h2>
 *
 * `incorrect-password` is a **403** — the token was fine and the second check failed — so it
 * sits under **Current password** and the session is untouched. `email-already-in-use` is a
 * **409**, which `EmailAlreadyInUseException` argues at length is not registration's
 * enumeration oracle: the caller is signed in, the endpoint is rate limited per account, and a
 * change that silently did nothing "would leave somebody waiting for a confirmation that is
 * never coming". So the sentence is shown, under the address field.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 — "authentication, account settings: none".
