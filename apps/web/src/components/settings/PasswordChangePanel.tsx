/**
 * §4.1's A-13 — changing the password with the current one. Issue #277.
 *
 * <h2>Succeeding signs this browser out, and the screen says so before it is pressed</h2>
 *
 * `POST /v1/auth/change-password` revokes **every** session for the account, the one that made
 * the request included. `AccountCredentialsService` argues the rule and rejects the friendlier
 * alternative in the same breath: "the person changing a password on a machine they suspect is
 * the one who most needs every other session to end, and 'every session except one' is a rule
 * the client would then have to be trusted to have picked correctly."
 *
 * `CredentialController` then hands the consequence to this component in as many words —
 * "saying so before the form is submitted is the client's job". That is the warning above the
 * fields, and it is not a toast afterwards. A sign-out somebody was told about is the price of
 * a security control; the same sign-out unannounced is an application that appears to have
 * crashed at the exact moment they touched their password, which is the moment they are least
 * inclined to give it the benefit of the doubt.
 *
 * <h2>Which is why there is no success state on this page</h2>
 *
 * There cannot be one that survives. The moment the session is dropped, `SessionProvider`'s
 * guard sees a signed-out reader on `/settings/password` — a path `requiresSession` matches —
 * and moves them. A confirmation panel rendered here would be destroyed by that redirect a
 * frame later, and a panel that suppressed the redirect would be a signed-out browser sitting
 * on a private route pretending otherwise.
 *
 * So the confirmation travels instead: this component navigates to the sign-in page and the
 * sign-in page says what happened, through `SIGN_IN_AFTER_PASSWORD_CHANGE`. A fixed parameter
 * name matched against a fixed value, never a sentence carried in a URL — see
 * `lib/auth/credentials.ts` for why that distinction is load-bearing.
 *
 * <h2>The wrong password is a 403, and it goes under the field it is about</h2>
 *
 * `AuthExceptionHandler` returns 403 rather than 401 precisely so a client does not react by
 * signing the reader in again "over a password typed into the wrong box" — the access token was
 * accepted and the second check is what failed. So the refusal keeps the form, keeps the
 * session, and puts the service's sentence under **Current password**, where `Field` wires it
 * to the control's `aria-describedby` and the announcement follows.
 *
 * `weak-password` is the same treatment against the other field, with the policy's own words:
 * `RegistrationRequest` deliberately annotates no length "so that one place decides what is
 * acceptable and the message a user sees is the same wherever a password is set", and a minimum
 * typed into this form would be a second opinion that goes stale the day the policy changes.
 *
 * <h2>Two boxes for the new password</h2>
 *
 * `PasswordResetConfirmForm`'s reason, weaker here and still worth the box: a typo costs the
 * account every one of its sessions and leaves somebody signing in with a password they do not
 * know. The comparison happens in this browser and the second value is never sent.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 — "authentication, account settings: none". Nothing on this panel
 * animates, including the warning, which has to be readable the instant the page paints rather
 * than 300ms after somebody has started typing.
