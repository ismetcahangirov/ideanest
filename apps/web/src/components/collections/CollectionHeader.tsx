/**
 * The head of a collection landing page — D-08, §4.13 WS-04.
 *
 * <h2>The trail is rendered as well as declared</h2>
 *
 * `collectionPageGraph` states it in JSON-LD for a crawler; this is the same trail for a
 * reader, and a page that only had the machine half would be one somebody lands on from a
 * search result with no way up. `aria-label` names it because the header's own `<nav>` is
 * otherwise indistinguishable from it — the rule `CategoryLanding` states for the same pair.
 *
 * <h2>What the window says, and what it deliberately does not</h2>
 *
 * A visible collection is always inside its own window: `PostgresCuratedCollections` selects
 * on `opens_at <= now()` and `closes_at > now()`, so a collection outside it is a 404 rather
 * than a page saying "closed". That is what makes "Closes 12 September 2026" a fact rather
 * than a guess.
 *
 * **It is a date and never a countdown.** The endpoint is cached for sixty seconds and this
 * page is revalidated on the same window, so a rendered "closes in 2 hours" can be two minutes
 * wrong the moment it is read — and on an open call, which is the one kind somebody acts on a
 * deadline for, being wrong about the deadline is the expensive failure.
 * docs/motion-system.md §6 makes the same call about a campaign countdown for a different
 * reason: it must not animate. Neither of these numbers should perform.
 *
 * <h2>The badge is stated, because membership means something</h2>
 *
 * §3.2 and §4.4 make an editorial badge a claim the platform makes about a campaign, and
 * `collections.grants_badge` is the column that decides whether being in this list is that
 * claim. A reader looking at a campaign carrying the badge should be able to find out where it
 * came from, and this is the page that says so. It is a sentence with an icon beside it, never
 * a colour on its own (docs/ui-kit.md §9.2).
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none, and the reason is the money</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 puts a discovery surface on a minimal budget and its one allowance
 * is a single `FadeUp` on a page heading. Taking it here would pull `@ideanest/ui/motion` and
 * its 116 kB of animation runtime into a route whose whole job is to be an indexable list of
 * campaigns — the same trade the category landing pages refused. Nothing on this header moves.
