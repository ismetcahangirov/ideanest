/**
 * A collection's campaigns, in the curator's order — D-08, §4.13 WS-04.
 *
 * <h2>Why this pages instead of handing the reader off to the feed</h2>
 *
 * `/categories/{slug}` and `/search` both show one page of results and then offer the same
 * query inside `/discover`, where the paging machinery already lives. Neither argument
 * survives here, and the reason is the one thing a curated list is: **the order**. It was
 * arranged by a person, row by row, and there is no filter on `/v1/discover` that reproduces
 * it — `?programme={slug}` narrows to an open call's members and then sorts them by whatever
 * the feed sorts by. Sending a reader to the feed for "the rest of this collection" would be
 * sending them to a different list with the same members.
 *
 * So it pages here, on the pattern `ProfileCampaignGrid` established: the first page comes
 * from the server render and the browser only ever asks for what comes after it.
 *
 * <h2>Seeded by the server, and never refetching the first page</h2>
 *
 * `app/(site)/collections/[slug]/page.tsx` fetched page one so that the campaigns are in the
 * HTML a crawler and a slow connection receive — this route exists to be indexed, and a grid
 * the browser assembles is a grid a crawler never sees. Handing that page to a hook that reads
 * on mount would mean requesting the same twenty-four rows a second time on every visit and
 * briefly rendering a skeleton over content already on screen. `getCollectionCampaigns` takes
 * a cursor and no null, so page one is not something this component can be talked into asking
 * for.
 *
 * <h2>A button, not an infinite scroll</h2>
 *
 * The feed's sentinel is right for an unbounded list somebody is grazing. A collection is a
 * bounded, edited sequence with a stated size in its own header, and the reader arrived to see
 * a specific list rather than to browse — an explicit control is also the one a keyboard reader
 * can operate at all, which a scroll sentinel is not. The button names the collection so that
 * two "Show more" controls in one document are two controls a screen reader can tell apart
 * (docs/ui-kit.md §9.4).
 *
 * <h2>A failed page does not destroy the pages already read</h2>
 *
 * An append that fails leaves the items and the cursor alone and reports the refusal beside
 * the button. A reader who has loaded four pages keeps four pages; blanking a list somebody is
 * reading is a worse answer than saying the next page did not arrive — the rule
 * `useDiscoveryFeed` states for the same failure.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §8 forbids animation in long lists, and appended pages are exactly the
 * case it names. The button changes its label while it waits; nothing moves.
