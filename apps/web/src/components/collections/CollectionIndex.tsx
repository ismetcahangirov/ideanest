/**
 * The body of `/collections` — D-08, §4.13 WS-04.
 *
 * <h2>It is the crawl path</h2>
 *
 * A collection landing page is worth building only if something links to it. §4.13 disallows
 * `/discover?` wholesale, the web feed exposes no `programme` filter, and a curated order is
 * not something a filter could express in any case — so before this page existed there was no
 * URL on the site that reached a collection. This is the one place that lists every visible
 * one as an ordinary link, which is what stops the landing pages being orphans in the sitemap.
 *
 * <h2>The order is the curator's, and the kinds are not separated</h2>
 *
 * `GET /v1/collections` answers in `sort_order`, which is a decision a curator made about what
 * the platform wants read first. Regrouping them here — open calls in one band, staff
 * selections in another — would overrule that decision in the client, and it would do it
 * invisibly: the person who set the order would see a different page from the one they
 * arranged. So there is one grid, and each card says what kind of list it is
 * (`CollectionCard`).
 *
 * <h2>A refused read and an empty platform look the same, and the page does not pretend
 * otherwise</h2>
 *
 * `fetchCollections` answers `null` for a service that refused or could not be reached, and an
 * empty array for a platform with nothing curated yet. Both render the same way here, because
 * the one useful thing to say is the same in both cases: the feed is reachable and carries
 * every campaign on the platform. `app/(site)/categories/page.tsx` takes the same line.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * No `FadeUp`, matching the category landing pages beside it. Discovery's budget allows one on
 * a page heading (docs/motion-system.md §5.1) and taking it here would cost the whole route
 * 116 kB of animation runtime — `FadeUp` lives behind `@ideanest/ui/motion` — on a page whose
 * entire purpose is to be a fast, indexable, server-rendered list of links. §8's target is the
 * one that wins: this is a discovery surface, and speed outranks the fade.
