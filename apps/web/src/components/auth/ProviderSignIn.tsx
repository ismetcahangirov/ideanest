/**
 * §4.1's A-04 and A-05 — Google and Apple, on the sign-in and registration screens. Issue #273.
 *
 * <h2>What this component is responsible for, and what it is not</h2>
 *
 * It obtains an ID token from a provider and hands it to `signInWithProvider`. **Nothing here
 * decides whether the token is genuine.** §17.1 lists the seven checks the service makes —
 * signature against the provider's JWKS, a pinned RS256, the issuer, the audience, the
 * expiry, the age, and the nonce — and every one of them has to happen on the other side. A
 * browser cannot verify a signature against a key set it also fetched.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing renders when nothing is configured</h2>
 *
 * §17.1: "a provider without them is not enabled and its endpoint answers 501". A button that
 * always fails is worse than no button, and on this screen it is worse still — it is offered
 * to somebody who has not got in yet. In a deployment with neither identifier set, and in
 * ordinary development, this component renders nothing at all and the email form stands
 * alone.
 *
 * <h2>Google renders Google's button; Apple does not get one</h2>
 *
 * THE ASYMMETRY IS THEIRS, NOT A PREFERENCE. Google Identity Services no longer offers a
 * reliable way to raise a credential prompt from a click — the One Tap prompt is
 * browser-arbitrated through FedCM and is suppressed after a dismissal — so the supported
 * path for a custom sign-in surface is `renderButton`, which draws Google's own control in an
 * iframe. It is configured `filled_black` and `pill`, which is as close to §7.2's shape as
 * their options reach; it will never be exactly the design system, and a control that looks
 * right and does not work is the worse trade.
 *
 * Apple's SDK exposes `AppleID.auth.signIn()`, a promise a click can call, so Apple gets an
 * ordinary `Pill` and looks like the rest of the screen.
 *
 * <h2>Apple sends a name once, and forwarding it is not optional</h2>
 *
 * §17.1: Apple puts it in the body of the **first** authorisation response, never in the ID
 * token and never again. It is used only when an account is created and never modifies an
 * existing one, so forwarding it on every sign-in is harmless — and dropping it once costs
 * somebody their display name permanently.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5's budget for authentication. The buttons take 150ms of colour on
 * hover from `Pill`; nothing else moves, including the failure, which appears outright.
