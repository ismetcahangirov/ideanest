/**
 * §4.1's A-06, second half — where the reset link lands. Issue #271.
 *
 * <h2>The link's one hour is the thing this screen exists to say out loud</h2>
 *
 * `ideanest.auth.password-reset-token-ttl` is `PT1H`, and `PasswordResetService` explains why
 * it is deliberately not the twenty-four hours a verification link gets: that link proves an
 * address, this one replaces a credential, and a forwarded message should stop being a key to
 * the account long before it stops being a proof of the mailbox.
 *
 * **One hour is short enough to be met, so it is stated in three places rather than one.**
 * `/reset-password` says it on the confirmation, this form says it above the fields while the
 * link still works, and the refusal below says it again with the way back attached. A generic
 * "something went wrong" at the end of that path would leave somebody re-reading a dead email
 * and concluding the platform is broken, when what they need is one sentence and one button.
 *
 * <h2>Three refusals wearing one code, and the service's sentence is the only one that knows</h2>
 *
 * `invalid-verification-link` is returned for a link that was never issued, one that expired,
 * and one that has already been spent — and the service writes a **different sentence for each**:
 * "This link is not valid.", "This link has expired. Ask for a new one." and "This link has
 * already been used." A client that collapsed them would tell somebody whose link expired
 * eleven minutes ago that they had already used it, which is both wrong and alarming — it reads
 * as "somebody else opened this".
 *
 * So the service's own sentence is printed (§10.4's rule), and what this screen adds is the
 * part the service cannot know: the lifetime, and the route back to asking for another link.
 *
 * <h2>A rejected password does not spend the link, so the form stays</h2>
 *
 * `PasswordResetService.reset` checks the policy **before** it claims the token, precisely so
 * that "the person fixing their typo would find the link dead" does not happen. Honouring that
 * is what separates `weak-password` from the other refusal here: it keeps the form, keeps the
 * token, and puts the policy's own words under the field. Sending somebody back to
 * `/reset-password` for a password that was merely too short would waste the property the
 * service went out of its way to give them.
 *
 * <h2>Two password boxes, unlike the register form</h2>
 *
 * `RegisterForm` asks once, and is right to: a typo there costs one failed sign-in attempt and
 * is discovered immediately. Here it costs the link. The token is single-use and an hour old,
 * so somebody who mistypes twice identically — which is what a single box cannot detect — sets
 * a password they do not know, on an account they cannot now reset again without waiting for a
 * second email. The second box is compared in the browser and never sent.
 *
 * <h2>The token is read from the URL and posted in a body</h2>
 *
 * `VerifyEmailView`'s arrangement, and its reasoning applies with more at stake: the email can
 * only send somebody to a URL, so the token does reach this application's address bar, and
 * what the `POST` buys is that it never leaves the browser as a request the service — or
 * anything between the two — writes to a log. The route is `noindex` and disallowed in
 * `robots.txt` for the same reason.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5's authentication row.
