/**
 * §4.1's A-07 and A-08 — the step between a password and a session. Issue #272.
 *
 * <h2>It is a step on the sign-in screen, not a route of its own</h2>
 *
 * THE CHALLENGE IS A CREDENTIAL FOR THE NEXT FEW MINUTES, which `TokenController` says in
 * those words when it marks the response `no-store`. Putting it in a URL — `/two-factor?c=…`
 * — would write it to access logs, keep it in browser history, and forward it in the
 * `Referer` header of whatever the page loads next. `VerifyEmailRequest` makes exactly that
 * argument about the verification token, and it holds here for the same reason.
 *
 * The alternatives were a route that reads the challenge from a store this application does
 * not have, or a route that is handed it through `history.state` and breaks on a reload. A
 * step in the form it came from has neither problem: the challenge never leaves memory, and a
 * reload correctly returns somebody to the password they have to enter again anyway — the
 * challenge is single-use and short-lived, so there is nothing to resume.
 *
 * So there is **no new route** for #272, and `apps/web/README.md`'s route table says so
 * rather than leaving somebody to look for one.
 *
 * <h2>The recovery code is on the same screen, behind a disclosure</h2>
 *
 * `/2fa/verify` accepts a generated code **or** a recovery code, and the person who needs the
 * second one is the person whose phone is broken, lost, or on the other side of a room. A
 * separate screen for it is a screen they have to find while locked out. It is collapsed by
 * default because it is not the ordinary path, and it is a `details` element rather than a
 * state toggle so it works before hydration and is announced as a disclosure.
 *
 * `TwoFactorProof` is a union, so exactly one of the two is sent — the service should not be
 * asked to decide which of two credentials somebody meant to spend.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 gives authentication a budget of "none — 150ms colour on
 * controls". This screen appears in place of the password fields with no transition, which is
 * the same decision `SignInForm` makes about its errors: an animated step change here reads
 * as hesitation on the screen where somebody is already waiting.
