/**
 * §4.1's A-02 — where the verification link lands. Issue #270.
 *
 * <h2>It redeems the token, rather than the link doing it</h2>
 *
 * `POST /v1/auth/verify-email` takes the token in a **body**, and `VerifyEmailRequest`
 * explains why: a query string is written to access logs, kept in browser history, and
 * forwarded in the `Referer` header of whatever the page loads next — and this value is a
 * credential until it is spent. So the email has to point at a page, and the page has to make
 * the request. That is this component.
 *
 * The token does still arrive in this page's own URL, which is unavoidable — an email client
 * can only send somebody to a URL. What the arrangement buys is that it never leaves the
 * browser's address bar as a request the service logs.
 *
 * <h2>It runs exactly once</h2>
 *
 * The token is single use — `EmailVerificationService.claim` is a conditional update — so a
 * second request for the same token is refused. React's development mode double-invokes
 * effects on purpose, and a component without the guard below would therefore show "this link
 * has already been used" to every developer who ever opened it. The ref is set synchronously,
 * before the await, which is what makes the guard hold across the second invocation rather
 * than racing it.
 *
 * <h2>The three ways it ends</h2>
 *
 * **Verified.** The account is usable. It does not sign anybody in — verification and
 * authentication are separate, and `EmailVerificationService` is explicit that verifying an
 * address must not authorise anything else.
 *
 * **Refused.** Expired, already spent, or never issued, and the page does not guess which:
 * the service's own sentence is shown (§10.4). What it adds is what to do, and that is where
 * an honest gap has to be stated — **there is no resend endpoint.** `RegistrationService`
 * answers a second registration for an existing address by publishing
 * `RegistrationAttemptedOnExistingAccount` and returning; it does not issue a new token. So
 * this page does not offer a resend button that would do nothing. What it says instead is
 * true: signing in still works, because `SignInService` deliberately allows it before the
 * address is verified, and the header carries the unverified state from there.
 *
 * **No token at all.** Somebody reached `/verify-email` directly. That is not an error and is
 * not presented as one.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5's authentication row. The status is announced through a live
 * region instead, because a screen whose only change is a heading swapping is a screen a
 * screen-reader user is not told about.
