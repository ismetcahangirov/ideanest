/**
 * §4.1's A-03 — email and password sign-in. Issue #268.
 *
 * <h2>The two refusals the issue names, and why they are not one message</h2>
 *
 * **`ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED` is a 403 and must not be rendered as a failed sign-in.** The password
 * was right. `AuthExceptionHandler` says 403 rather than 401 precisely so that a client stops
 * offering to try again — a 401 would put somebody in a loop with a password that works. So
 * this form hides the submit button on that one refusal and shows what actually helps, which
 * is that support is the way through.
 *
 * **The rate limit is a 429 with a `Retry-After`,** and §17.3 sets it at five attempts per
 * fifteen minutes. Saying how long is left is the difference between waiting and pressing the
 * button until the window resets. `describeAuthFailure` owns both branches, so the register
 * page cannot come to a different conclusion about the same status.
 *
 * Everything else is the service's own sentence, verbatim (§10.4). Nothing here writes "wrong
 * email or password": the endpoint deliberately does not say which, and inventing a message
 * would be inventing a claim about which half was wrong.
 *
 * <h2>Where it goes afterwards</h2>
 *
 * `?next=` when there is one, reduced to a path on this origin by `safeReturnPath` — an open
 * redirect on a sign-in page is the classic phishing primitive, and that module lists every
 * shape it refuses. `replace`, not `push`: leaving the sign-in form in the history means Back
 * returns a signed-in reader to a form they have already completed.
 *
 * The session is re-read before navigating, so the header shows the reader's name on the page
 * they land on rather than a frame later.
 *
 * <h2>Two-factor, and the providers</h2>
 *
 * `POST /v1/auth/login` answers 200 with a challenge instead of tokens when the account has a
 * second factor confirmed, and #272 built the step that answers it. **It is a state of this
 * form rather than a route**, because the challenge is a credential for the next few minutes
 * and a URL is the one place a credential must not go — `TwoFactorChallenge` argues it at
 * length.
 *
 * `ProviderSignIn` (#273) sits below the form and shares this component's outcome handler,
 * because `TokenController` answers a provider sign-in through the same `respondTo`: an
 * account with a second factor gets a challenge whichever way the password step was passed,
 * and a provider button that skipped it would make two-factor advisory.
 *
 * <h2>What #271 and #277 added to this screen</h2>
 *
 * A link to `/reset-password`, which this form deliberately refused to carry while there was
 * no page behind it, and a notice for somebody who has just changed their password. The second
 * is here rather than on `/settings/password` because that screen cannot survive its own
 * success: `POST /v1/auth/change-password` revokes every session including the caller's, so the
 * route guard moves the reader off a private path before any confirmation could be read. The
 * confirmation travels in a fixed query value instead, never as text — see the comment beside
 * it.
 *
 * <h2>Motion</h2>
 *
 * None. docs/motion-system.md §5: authentication gets "150ms colour on controls", and an
 * error that animates in is one that arrives after it was needed.
