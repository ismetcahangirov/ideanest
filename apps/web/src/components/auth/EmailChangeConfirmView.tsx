/**
 * §4.1's A-12, second half — where the address-change confirmation lands. Issue #277.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a public route and not a settings screen</h2>
 *
 * `POST /v1/auth/confirm-email-change` is unauthenticated, and `CredentialController` says why
 * in one sentence: "the person following it is reading the new mailbox, which is the one place
 * they are least likely to be signed in". A landing page behind the session guard would send
 * that person to a sign-in form, and the address they would sign in with is the *old* one — the
 * account has not moved yet. So the page sits in `app/(auth)` beside `/verify-email`, which
 * solved the identical problem for A-02, and it takes that route group's frame, its `noindex`,
 * and its `robots.txt` disallow.
 *
 * <h2>It runs exactly once</h2>
 *
 * The token is spent by a conditional update — `EmailChangeRequestRepository.claim` — so a
 * second request for the same token is refused with "This link has already been used." React's
 * development mode double-invokes effects on purpose, and a component without the guard below
 * would show that refusal to every developer who ever opened it. The ref is set synchronously,
 * before the await, which is what makes the guard hold across the second invocation rather than
 * racing it. `VerifyEmailView` carries the same guard for the same reason.
 *
 * <h2>The two refusals are different outcomes, not two spellings of one</h2>
 *
 * **`invalid-verification-link`** is a link that cannot work — never issued, expired after six
 * hours, or already spent — and the service writes a different sentence for each, which is the
 * sentence printed here.
 *
 * **`email-already-in-use`** is a link that could have worked and was overtaken: somebody
 * registered the address between the request and the click. `AccountCredentialsService` rolls
 * the claim back in that case, deliberately, "so a change that becomes possible again can still
 * be confirmed" — the link is **not** spent. That is a materially different thing to tell
 * somebody, and it is why this screen does not fold the two into one apology.
 *
 * <h2>It does not sign anybody in, and it does not sign anybody out</h2>
 *
 * An address change revokes no sessions: nothing about the credential changed, and the sessions
 * were issued to the same person. Somebody already signed in elsewhere stays signed in and
 * their address has moved under them, which is why the old address is written to as well.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5's authentication row. The status is announced through a live region
 * instead, because a screen whose only change is a heading swapping is a screen a screen-reader
 * user is not told about.
