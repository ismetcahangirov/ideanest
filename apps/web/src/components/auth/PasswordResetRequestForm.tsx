/**
 * §4.1's A-06, first half — asking for a reset link. Issue #271.
 *
 * <h2>The screen after submitting is the whole design, and it is written to be true</h2>
 *
 * `POST /v1/auth/forgot-password` answers **202 whether or not the address has an account**,
 * and `PasswordResetService` gives the reason: an endpoint that answered "no such account" is
 * an enumeration oracle producing exactly the list somebody wants before writing a phishing
 * email — which people on a breach list have accounts here.
 *
 * **A client can give that away without the endpoint saying a word.** "Check your inbox — we
 * have sent you a link" is a claim about an account, and it is a claim this application was
 * deliberately not told enough to make. So the state below says *if*: the request was accepted,
 * and a link is on its way if the address has an account. That sentence is exactly as true for
 * an address with no account as for one with, which is the property the 202 was chosen for.
 *
 * The consequence to accept honestly is that somebody who mistyped their address gets a
 * reassuring screen and no email. That is why the address is echoed back — a typo is the most
 * common reason nothing arrives, and it is the reader's own address rather than anything the
 * service disclosed — and why the way back to this form stays on the screen.
 *
 * <h2>The lifetime is said here, before anybody is waiting on it</h2>
 *
 * The link works for one hour and once. Saying so on the confirmation, rather than only in the
 * refusal an hour later, is the difference between a constraint and a surprise: somebody who
 * reads "one hour" goes and looks now, and somebody who does not comes back tomorrow to a page
 * that tells them off. `auth.reset.lifetime` is the single source of the phrase — both this
 * screen's copy and `/reset-password/confirm`'s read that one key — so the two cannot disagree
 * about it.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5's authentication row. The confirmation replaces the form outright.
