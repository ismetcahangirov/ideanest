/**
 * §4.1's A-01 — account creation, and the "check your email" state that follows it. Issue
 * #269.
 *
 * <h2>The success state is the interesting half</h2>
 *
 * `POST /v1/auth/register` answers **202 whether or not the address was already registered**,
 * and `AuthController` gives the reason at length: an endpoint that answered differently for a
 * known address hands anybody with a breach list the subset of it that has an account here.
 *
 * That decision only holds if the client honours it, and honouring it has a consequence worth
 * stating plainly: **this form cannot tell somebody "that address is already registered", and
 * must not try.** So the screen it shows afterwards is written to be true either way — it says
 * what was sent to the address, not what was created. Somebody who already had an account gets
 * a message telling them so, at the address, which is where it belongs.
 *
 * It also means there is nothing to sign in with yet. Registration issues no session; the
 * verification link is what makes the account usable, and the screen says so rather than
 * leaving somebody waiting on a redirect that is not coming.
 *
 * <h2>The password rule is the service's</h2>
 *
 * `RegistrationRequest` deliberately does not annotate a length — the policy decides, "so that
 * one place decides what is acceptable and the message a user sees is the same wherever a
 * password is set". A minimum typed into this form would be a second opinion that goes stale
 * the day the policy changes. What is shown before submitting is the hint the service's own
 * refusal would say, and what is shown after a refusal is that refusal.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5's authentication row. The success state replaces the form outright
 * rather than transitioning into it.
