/**
 * The server-rendered first page — #119, from the client's side of it.
 *
 * The complaint #119 makes is that `/discover` shipped an empty grid: the feed was fetched
 * in the browser, so a crawler and a link unfurler were served a skeleton. The page now
 * fetches page one on the server and hands it here. What that has to mean, and what these
 * tests hold it to:
 *
 *   - **the cards are rendered without a request.** If the browser fetched anyway, the
 *     markup would be right and the request would be pure waste on the platform's busiest
 *     read;
 *   - **a seeded page for a different filter set is ignored.** The key is what makes that
 *     checkable, and showing one filter's cards under another filter's URL is the bug it
 *     prevents;
 *   - **no seed is a supported state.** The server read can fail, and the view then behaves
 *     exactly as it did before #119 rather than rendering an error;
 *   - **paging still works from a seeded page.** The cursor comes from the server's page,
 *     so "show more" has to continue from it rather than re-request page one.
 *
 * A separate file from `DiscoveryView.test.tsx` because it needs a different `next/navigation`
 * fixture — a fixed query string rather than one the router rewrites — and the two harnesses
 * in one file would be two ways to answer "what does the address bar say".
