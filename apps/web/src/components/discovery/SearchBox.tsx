/**
 * D-01's search box and D-02's autocomplete, on the discovery feed.
 *
 * THE TYPED VALUE AND THE URL ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS, on purpose. What is in
 * the box is a draft: it changes on every keystroke and means nothing to the
 * feed until it is submitted. What is in the URL is the search: it is what the
 * feed is showing, what a shared link carries, and what the back button
 * restores. Sending every keystroke to the URL would put a history entry behind
 * each letter — "back" would then walk the reader through their own typing —
 * and would refetch the feed six times for one word.
 *
 * The draft is re-seeded from the URL whenever the URL's query changes, so a
 * back press or a shared link opens with the box holding what the feed is
 * actually showing rather than the last thing this session typed.
 *
 * WHAT SELECTING A ROW DOES DEPENDS ON THE ROW, which is the whole reason the
 * endpoint sends a kind per row (`Suggestion.Kind`):
 *
 *   campaign     open that campaign. The reader found the thing they were
 *                looking for; making them read a one-result feed first is a
 *                step with nothing in it.
 *   category     apply the category filter that #45 already implements, and
 *   subcategory  clear the search text. Searching for the word "games" ranks
 *   tag          campaigns that happen to contain it; filtering by the Games
 *                category returns the campaigns that ARE games. The reader
 *                picked the row that says "Category", so they get the filter.
 *   plain text   search for what was typed.
 *
 * A FAILED SUGGESTION REQUEST IS NOT A BROKEN SEARCH BOX. The refusal is shown
 * in the reader's way — in the service's own words, never a generic apology
 * (§10.4) — and Enter still submits what was typed, because the feed is a
 * different endpoint and there is no reason it should be unreachable.
 *
 * MOTION: none. docs/motion-system.md §5.1 gives Discovery's filter rail "150ms
 * colour only", because "a panel that animates while somebody is using it is a
 * panel that is slower to use". A list read between two keystrokes is that
 * panel with less time to spare.
