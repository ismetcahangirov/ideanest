/**
 * Everything currently narrowing the feed, as chips that remove themselves.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS BESIDE THE RAIL. The rail is long, and a filter ticked in a
 * group that has scrolled out of view is a filter the reader has forgotten they
 * applied — which is how "the platform has nothing" gets concluded from a feed
 * narrowed by four choices. The chip row is the whole active set in one line.
 *
 * THE ACCESSIBLE NAME SAYS WHAT REMOVING DOES. "Live", announced as a button,
 * is a control whose name is what it is about rather than what it does; a row
 * of them is unusable by ear. Each chip announces "Remove Status filter: Live",
 * which contains the visible text so speech input still reaches it by the word
 * on it (WCAG 2.5.3).
 *
 * WHITE, NOT LIME. An applied filter is where the reader is, not something to
 * hurry about (docs/ui-kit.md §7.3).
