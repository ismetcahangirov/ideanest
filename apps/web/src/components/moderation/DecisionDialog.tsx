 * Every `description` says what the decision does AND what it does not do. The service is
 * emphatic that upholding a report does not suspend anything and that rejecting a campaign
 * does not close the complaint; a moderator who believes one button did both has been misled
 * by the interface into thinking a job is finished. Those sentences are copy and they are in
 * `messages/*.json` since #324.
 *
 * <p><strong>`noteRequired` and `destructive` stayed here</strong>, because neither is a
 * word. One mirrors what the service's request body demands and the other decides which
 * token the confirm control is painted in — a translator who could change either would be
 * able to turn off a validation rule or make a rejection look ordinary by editing a
 * sentence.
 *
 * <h2>Two ways to name the target, and Russian is why</h2>
 *
 * A report outcome says "the complaint about <em>campaign 1a2b3c4d</em>" and a campaign
 * outcome says "<em>campaign 1a2b3c4d</em> is cleared for launch". The noun is the object of
 * the first and the subject of the second, which is one word in English and two in Russian —
 * so the name is built from `targetName` in one branch and `campaignName` in the other.
