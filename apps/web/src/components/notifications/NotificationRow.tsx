/**
 * One row of the inbox.
 *
 * <h2>Unread is a word as well as a dot</h2>
 *
 * CLAUDE.md §2 forbids colour carrying meaning on its own, and "unread" is exactly the kind
 * of state a coloured dot is usually asked to carry alone. So the dot is `aria-hidden` and
 * the row states it in text — visible text, not only a screen-reader string, because the
 * people a colour-only cue fails include sighted readers.
 *
 * <h2>Two controls, and why the link is one of them</h2>
 *
 * Opening a notification is what marks it read, which is what a reader expects and what
 * stops the badge counting things somebody has already dealt with. So the headline is a
 * link that navigates *and* reports the read, and there is a separate button for the rows
 * with nowhere to go and for a reader who wants to clear one without opening it.
 *
 * A row whose document names no campaign has no link at all — `describe.ts` argues why an
 * inbox row that goes nowhere useful is better as plain text than as a live-looking link.
 *
 * MOTION IS NEAR ZERO, following `SessionsPanel`: this is a screen where somebody is
 * working through a list, not exploring, so it gets colour on hover and nothing else. §8
 * rules out staggering a list regardless.
