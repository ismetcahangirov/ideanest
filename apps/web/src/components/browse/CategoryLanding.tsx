/**
 * The body of a category or subcategory landing page — §4.13 WS-05, issue #265.
 *
 * <h2>Why these pages exist at all</h2>
 *
 * §4.13 puts it in one line: **a crawler cannot operate a filter.** `/discover?category=games`
 * has always existed and has never been indexable — `lib/seo/indexability.ts` disallows
 * `/discover?` wholesale because the filters compose into a combinatorial set of query strings
 * describing one corpus, and `lib/seo/sitemap/entries.ts` records that the taxonomy "would
 * make excellent landing pages" and had no URL that reached one. These are those URLs.
 *
 * <h2>One component, two routes</h2>
 *
 * A category page and a subcategory page differ in three things: the heading, the filter, and
 * whether there is a row of children to offer. Everything else — the grid, the count, the
 * empty state, the way into the feed — is the same, and writing it twice is writing two
 * pages that will disagree about the empty state within a month.
 *
 * <h2>The link into the feed is the point of the page's foot</h2>
 *
 * A landing page shows a slice and stops; the feed is where somebody narrows further, sorts,
 * and pages. So the last thing on every one of these is the same category with the filter
 * already applied, in `/discover`, where the rest of §4.3 lives.
 *
 * <h2>It reads the catalogue itself — issue #324</h2>
 *
 * There is no `'use client'` here or anywhere beneath it, which is what makes it an ordinary
 * async server component: it can await `getTranslations` and does, rather than being handed a
 * copy object by two routes that would then have to agree about what to resolve. That is the
 * arrangement `CampaignSummary` and `CollectionIndex` already use; the prop-threading in
 * `components/auth` and `components/checkout` exists because those subtrees are client
 * components and cannot.
 *
 * <p>The counts go through ICU rather than a ternary. "1 campaign" against "2 campaigns" is
 * the whole of English and none of Russian, which has three forms and picks between them by
 * the last digit.
