/**
 * §4.2's profile editor — P-01 to P-03, issue #276.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER:
 *
 *   - **every field opens holding what the service says is there.** A form that rendered
 *     blank controls over a stored profile is a form whose first save deletes five fields
 *     somebody never touched.
 *   - **an untouched field is absent from the request body.** `PATCH /v1/me/profile` is
 *     three-way — absent leaves alone, `null` clears, a value sets — and sending all six keys
 *     every time would make two tabs open on one account overwrite each other silently. This
 *     is the assertion that keeps `editFrom` a diff.
 *   - **an emptied field sends `null` and never `""`.** They are different instructions to
 *     the endpoint and identical states on screen, so the conversion happens once, on the way
 *     out, and nothing else can be relied on to notice.
 *   - **a refusal lands under the control it is about.** The service names the field in
 *     `meta.field` precisely so that "a link has to start with https://" appears beneath the
 *     website rather than in a banner over a form with six controls in it. The test asserts
 *     the `aria-invalid` as well as the sentence, because a message beside the wrong input is
 *     the same defect as no message.
 *   - **the cap and the one-link-per-platform rule are visible before the server enforces
 *     them.** Five is the most a profile carries and a platform appears once; both are stated
 *     in words rather than by a control that stops working, and the second is made
 *     unreachable rather than merely refused.
 *   - **the handle is presented as fixed, with the reason.** `slug` is readable and has no
 *     key on the write. docs/ui-kit.md §7.13's argument about a hint applies here: a disabled
 *     box with no sentence tells somebody the thing is broken rather than decided.
 *   - **the form renders from the response, not from its own draft.** The endpoint answers
 *     200 with the whole profile because the result is not inferable from the request — text
 *     comes back trimmed and a location comes back with a name this browser never sent.
 *   - the avatar says plainly that nothing is uploaded, because §13.1's pipeline does not
 *     exist and a control that implied otherwise would be worse than the missing feature.
