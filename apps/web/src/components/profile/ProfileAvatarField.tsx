/**
 * §4.2's P-01, as much of it as the platform can do — the profile picture.
 *
 * <h2>P-01 IS "AVATAR UPLOAD AND CROP", AND NEITHER HALF EXISTS YET</h2>
 *
 * There is no object storage, no `media` table and no ingestion pipeline: §13.1 is a
 * different epic and nothing in this repository puts a file anywhere. **Upload and crop wait
 * on §13.1** and this control is not a down payment on them — when that pipeline lands, this
 * component is replaced rather than extended, exactly as
 * `components/campaign-editor/CoverImageField` says of itself.
 *
 * What the account *can* record is one column, `users.avatar_url`, so that is what this
 * collects: the address of a picture that is already published. The `InlineAlert` says so in
 * the first thing a reader meets, because a control that implied an upload and then did not
 * perform one would be a worse failure than the missing feature.
 *
 * <h2>The drop zone still earns its place, and it is not decoration</h2>
 *
 * `CoverImageField` makes the argument and it holds here with a different measurement at the
 * end of it. Somebody holding a photograph on their laptop has one question this browser can
 * actually answer — *what will this look like in a circle* — and dropping the file answers it
 * without publishing anything anywhere. So the zone measures, reports the pixel size, says
 * whether the image is square, and states plainly that nothing was uploaded. A `FileDropZone`
 * that silently did nothing would be worse than no drop zone at all.
 *
 * **No minimum is asserted**, unlike the cover's 1024×576. §5.3 makes that one a submission
 * requirement and this repository has no equivalent rule for an avatar; inventing a threshold
 * here would be this component taking a product decision inside a hint string.
 *
 * <h2>Square, because the frame is a circle</h2>
 *
 * `ProfileHeader` renders the avatar `rounded-full` with `object-cover`, so a portrait
 * photograph loses its top and bottom and a panorama loses its sides. That is the crop P-01
 * would let somebody choose and today cannot, which makes saying it out loud the only thing
 * this control can offer in its place.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 — "authentication, account settings: none, 150ms colour on
 * controls". Nothing here enters, fades or moves; the preview appears when the address does.
