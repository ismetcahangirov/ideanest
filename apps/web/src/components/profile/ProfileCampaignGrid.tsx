/**
 * One profile tab's list of campaigns — §4.2 P-04 and P-05, issue #274.
 *
 * <h2>It is seeded by the server and never refetches its first page</h2>
 *
 * `useCursorList` in `components/account` is the same machine and is deliberately not used
 * here, because it reads on mount from a null cursor. This list already has its first page:
 * `app/u/[slug]/page.tsx` fetched it on the server so that the campaigns are in the HTML a
 * crawler and a slow connection receive. Handing that page to the account hook would mean
 * requesting the same twenty-four rows a second time on every visit, and briefly rendering a
 * skeleton over content that is already on screen.
 *
 * So this holds the seed and only ever asks for what comes after it. Everything else — the
 * opaque cursor, the append, the "the next page did not load" message that does not destroy
 * the pages already read — is the same behaviour, restated in the twenty lines that are
 * actually different.
 *
 * <h2>Which reader it uses is decided from a string, not passed in</h2>
 *
 * A function prop cannot cross a server-to-client boundary, and this component is rendered
 * from a Server Component. `kind` is the serialisable version of that choice and it is also
 * what decides whether money may be printed — see `ProfileCampaignCard`, which requires the
 * caller to say so in writing.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §8 forbids animation in long lists, and appended pages are exactly
 * the case it names. The button changes its label while it waits; nothing moves.
