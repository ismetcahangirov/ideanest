/**
 * §4.2's P-07 — whether `/u/{slug}` answers at all. Issue #274.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is on `/settings/privacy` and not on a profile editor</h2>
 *
 * §4.2's note is explicit that P-01 to P-03 have no screen, because there is no `PATCH /v1/me`
 * to save a name or a biography to; an entry pointing at a page that cannot work is worse than
 * no entry. This control has an endpoint of its own and therefore has to live somewhere, and
 * `/settings/privacy` is already the page about who can see what — it holds the data export
 * and the account closure, which are the two other answers to "what does IdeaNest hold about
 * me and who can read it". A `/settings/profile` built to hold one switch would be a screen
 * whose other four fields are the ones that do not exist yet.
 *
 * It sits **above** the export and the closure: those two are read top to bottom as one
 * argument (`app/settings/privacy/page.tsx` explains the order), and inserting a switch
 * between them would break it.
 *
 * <h2>The switch reads its own position from the thing it decides</h2>
 *
 * There is no `GET` for this setting — `GET /v1/me` carries six fields and visibility is not
 * one of them — so the panel asks the public endpoint about the reader's own slug,
 * anonymously, and reads 200 as `PUBLIC` and 404 as `PRIVATE`. `probeProfileVisibility`
 * carries the full argument, including why the request must not send the access token.
 *
 * The alternatives were both worse. Assuming `PUBLIC` because that is the column default
 * would show the wrong position to everybody who has already turned it off — and the first
 * thing they would do is press the switch, which would write the value it already had and
 * leave them believing they had just hidden a profile that was never shown. Offering two
 * buttons and no state asks somebody to make a decision the interface refuses to tell them
 * they have already made.
 *
 * When the probe cannot answer — the service is unreachable, or replies something the
 * contract does not describe — the switch is disabled and says so. **It does not guess.** A
 * control that picks a position and then writes it is a control that overwrites a choice
 * nobody revisited.
 *
 * <h2>The write is confirmed by re-reading, not assumed</h2>
 *
 * `PATCH` answers 204 with no body, so the only evidence the new value took is another probe.
 * The switch moves optimistically because the round trip is two requests and a setting that
 * lags behind the finger feels broken — and it moves **back** if either request refuses, with
 * a sentence saying which position is actually in force. An optimistic switch that cannot
 * revert is a lie with a nice animation.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: 150ms, which is the thumb and nothing else</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 gives account settings "none — 150ms colour on controls", and
 * `Switch` already animates only its thumb's `transform`. Nothing here enters or fades.
