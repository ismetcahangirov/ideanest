/**
 * §4.2's P-04 and P-05, on one card — issue #274.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER:
 *
 *   - **the backed card prints no amounts.** This is the test the whole issue turns on. P-04
 *     is "Backed projects archive (no amounts)", and the failure it guards against is not a
 *     crash or a wrong figure — it is a correct figure printed where it should not be, which
 *     nobody notices in review because the card looks *better* with it. So the assertion is
 *     written against the rendered text: no currency, no percentage, no goal, whatever the
 *     service happened to send.
 *   - the created card does print them, because a creator's own campaign publishes its goal
 *     and its total on every other surface the platform has.
 *   - the completion figure is text as well as a bar, because a bar that only changes colour
 *     has said nothing to a screen reader (docs/ui-kit.md §8.2).
 *   - a campaign with no goal gets no progress bar rather than "0% funded", which would tell a
 *     reader it failed to raise a goal it never set.
