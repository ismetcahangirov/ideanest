/**
 * The profile's three sections — §4.2 P-04, P-05 and P-06, issue #274.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a real tab widget when `EditorShell`'s is deliberately not</h2>
 *
 * `components/campaign-editor/EditorShell` argues at length that its sections are links and
 * must not carry `role="tab"`: each one is a route, and ARIA tabs over routing break the back
 * button, "open in a new tab", and a copyable address. That argument is exactly right there
 * and does not apply here, because the opposite is true of this page — **the three panels are
 * one document.** All three are already rendered, by one server request, from one profile;
 * nothing is fetched when a tab is pressed and nothing navigates. A `<nav>` of links to
 * `?tab=backed` would turn a state change into a round trip to Next's router for content that
 * is already on the screen.
 *
 * The cost is that the open tab has no address of its own, so a link cannot point at somebody's
 * backed archive. That is the trade, taken knowingly: a profile is a page about a person and
 * the created list is what a link to it should show. If a shareable tab is ever wanted, the
 * fix is three routes and `EditorShell`'s pattern, not a query parameter bolted onto this one.
 *
 * <h2>The keyboard contract, in full</h2>
 *
 * Exactly the APG tabs pattern, because a widget that takes `role="tab"` has promised it:
 *
 *   - **one tab stop for the whole list.** The selected tab is `tabIndex={0}` and the others
 *     are `-1`, so Tab moves past the tablist into the panel rather than through three
 *     controls. A tablist that costs three tab stops is a tablist that should have been links.
 *   - **Left and Right move the selection, and wrap.** The list is short and bounded, so a
 *     wrap costs one keypress and a hard stop costs the reader the fact that the list ended.
 *   - **Home and End** go to the first and last.
 *   - **selection follows focus.** Automatic activation is correct precisely because every
 *     panel is already in the document: the reason the APG warns against it — arrowing
 *     through tabs firing a request each — cannot happen here. Manual activation would mean
 *     a keyboard reader has to press Enter to see what a pointer reader sees by hovering
 *     nothing at all.
 *
 * The panel itself carries `tabIndex={0}` so that a reader who tabs out of the tablist lands
 * inside the content rather than on the first link in it, and so a panel with no focusable
 * element in it is still reachable.
 *
 * <h2>Colour is never the state</h2>
 *
 * The selected tab is `--white-surface`, not lime: a section you are looking at is where you
 * are, not something urgent — the same rule the filter chip follows (docs/ui-kit.md §7.3).
 * And the fill is not what says which tab is open; `aria-selected` does, and the count beside
 * each label is text (§9.2).
 *
 * <h2>Motion: 150ms colour, and nothing else</h2>
 *
 * No entry animation on the panel. A panel that fades in is a panel that arrives after it was
 * asked for, and docs/motion-system.md §8 rules out animating a list of cards regardless.

  /** Stable, and part of the generated element ids. */
  readonly key: string;
  readonly label: string;
  /**
   * The number beside the label — **only ever a total that is actually known**.
   *
   * `GET /v1/users/{slug}` carries no counts, and it carries none for a module-boundary
   * reason rather than an accidental one (`lib/profiles/api.ts` explains). So the only figure
   * this application can put here is the length of a list it has loaded, and that is a total
   * exactly when the list has no next page.
   *
   * The caller therefore passes a count for a single-page list and **omits it otherwise**,
   * rather than printing the size of the first page. "24" beside a creator with two hundred
   * campaigns is not an approximation, it is a wrong number, and a reader has no way to tell
   * it from a right one. Omitted for the About tab as well, where there is nothing to count.
