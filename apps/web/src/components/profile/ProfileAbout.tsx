/**
 * §4.2's P-06 — the About tab.
 *
 * <h2>What it holds, and it says so when it holds one of them</h2>
 *
 * The biography, where somebody is, their site, the accounts they keep elsewhere, and the
 * month the account was created. Most accounts have written no biography, so the empty branch
 * is the common case rather than the edge — and it is a sentence rather than a blank panel,
 * because a tab that opens onto nothing reads as a tab that failed to load. `bio` arrives as
 * `null` rather than absent when there is none, so the empty state is an answer this
 * component has received rather than one it is waiting for.
 *
 * <h2>The location is here rather than in the header, and the header's own comment is why</h2>
 *
 * `ProfileHeader` states that it "carries the identity and nothing else" — a picture, a name,
 * a handle — and pushes the biography down here on the grounds that a header repeating it
 * would make this tab a duplicate of the top of the page. A city is the same kind of fact as
 * the biography and the joined month, and it belongs in the same list as them.
 *
 * **It is text and not a link, which is a fact about the platform rather than a design.**
 * `location.slug` is V16's shared vocabulary and §4.2 records that it is the vocabulary
 * `/discover?city=` reads — but `?city=` is one of the four options the discovery service
 * declares and refuses, answering `DISCOVERY_OPTION_UNSUPPORTED` and naming #47.
 * `lib/discovery/vocabulary.ts` lists it among the gaps for exactly this reason: a control
 * that cannot work is a promise the interface breaks the first time somebody uses it. When
 * #47 lands, this becomes a link and nothing else about it changes.
 *
 * <h2>EVERY OUTBOUND LINK ON THIS PANEL CARRIES `rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer"`</h2>
 *
 * The website and every social address are strings a stranger typed into a form, published on
 * a page search engines index. `PublicProfileResponse`'s Javadoc states the contract and gives
 * a different reason for each of the three tokens, and none of them is optional here:
 *
 *   - **`nofollow ugc`** — a profile link is the cheapest backlink a spammer can get anywhere
 *     on this platform. Without it the profile editor is an SEO product being given away.
 *   - **`noopener`** — a link opened in a new tab hands the destination a `window.opener`
 *     reference to this page, which is enough to navigate it elsewhere. A convincing sign-in
 *     page is one line of JavaScript away.
 *   - **`noreferrer`** — which profile somebody was reading is nobody's business but theirs,
 *     and a `Referer` header tells every site they click through to exactly that.
 *
 * The service refuses anything that is not `https://`, which closes `javascript:` and `data:`
 * outright. It closes nothing else, which is the whole reason these four tokens exist.
 *
 * <h2>The address is shown, never hidden behind a word</h2>
 *
 * A link whose visible text conceals where it goes is the shape of every phishing link ever
 * written, and this is a page where the destination was chosen by somebody the reader has no
 * reason to trust yet. So the platform's name is the label and the address is printed beside
 * it, and the website's row is the address itself.
 *
 * <h2>The biography is text, never markup</h2>
 *
 * It is rendered as a string into a `<p>` with `whitespace-pre-line`, so the paragraph breaks
 * somebody typed survive and nothing they typed becomes an element. §4.2's P-03 is the answer
 * to what that costs — somebody who wants a link on their profile is given five fields for
 * them, each one checked and each one rendered with the `rel` above, rather than a biography
 * that parses.
