/**
 * The console's own navigation — §4.11, issue #294.
 *
 * <h2>A client boundary, and only for `usePathname`</h2>
 *
 * Nothing here has state and nothing fetches. What it needs is the current path, to mark one
 * entry `aria-current="page"`, and that is not knowable in a layout on the server without
 * every page threading its own path down — a rule somebody eventually forgets and nothing
 * catches. `AccountNav` draws the same boundary for the same reason.
 *
 * <h2>The entries are read from the module list rather than passed in</h2>
 *
 * Unlike `AccountNav`, which takes its words as props because they come out of the message
 * catalogue on the server. There is no catalogue here — `lib/admin/navigation.ts` says why
 * the console is English — so importing the list costs the browser the same handful of
 * strings the props would have, and having one source means the rail and the console index
 * cannot disagree about what exists.
 *
 * <h2>`aria-current` carries it; the treatment is the second signal</h2>
 *
 * docs/ui-kit.md §9.2 forbids colour alone. The current entry is white on `--surface-2` with
 * a lime rule down its leading edge, and it is the `aria-current` a screen reader reads.
 *
 * <h2>It scrolls on its own Y axis, and here it had to</h2>
 *
 * The fix `AccountNav` took in #349, applied to the rail that needed it more. `sticky` pins
 * this below the header and keeps it there while the page moves, which is the point of it;
 * the consequence was that a rail taller than the viewport had a bottom nobody could reach.
 * Scrolling the page moved the screen on the right and left the rail exactly where it was.
 *
 * <p>The account rail has thirteen destinations and could hide its last group on a short
 * laptop. This one has **twenty-six across six groups** — `CONSOLE_GROUPS` is the whole
 * console — so on any ordinary viewport the last group or two were unreachable by
 * construction rather than at a particular zoom level. Support, the staff roster and the
 * health board sat below the fold of a container that does not scroll.
 *
 * <p>`100dvh` and not `100vh`: the dynamic unit tracks a collapsing browser toolbar, and
 * `vh` would size the rail to a viewport the reader does not have. `overscroll-contain` is
 * the half that makes it independent rather than merely scrollable — without it, reaching the
 * end of the rail hands the wheel to the page and scrolls the screen nobody was looking at.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 gives an administrative surface the same budget as account
 * settings — none, beyond 150ms of colour on a control. A console is worked in, and a rail
 * that animated would animate on every screen in it.
