/**
 * §4.11's AD-13: volume, success rate, average pledge — issue #313.
 *
 * <h2>Three of the five, and the screen names the other two</h2>
 *
 * AD-13 lists "volume, success rate, average pledge, cohorts, funnels". The first three are
 * here. Cohorts and funnels are not, and the reasons come from the service in `notBuilt` rather
 * than being written into this file — a cohort needs a rollup keyed on a backer&apos;s first
 * pledge and a funnel needs the visit-to-pledge path, and neither exists.
 *
 * Approximating them from what is here would put two numbers on a dashboard that look like
 * cohorts and funnels and are not, which is the failure the console index avoids for its
 * blocked modules by naming what each is waiting on.
 *
 * <h2>One currency, and the exclusion is on the screen</h2>
 *
 * §21.2 refuses to convert between currencies for anything that moves money, and a figure a
 * director reads is not exempt. Pledges in another currency are counted and reported rather
 * than folded in — a total with a silent exclusion is worse than one with a stated gap.
 *
 * <h2>The chart is CSS, not a charting library</h2>
 *
 * Bars sized by percentage, and nothing imported. A charting library in a
 * `transpilePackages` graph lands in the shared chunk for every console route — `MinimalShell`
 * records what that cost the last time — and this is one screen with one series. It is also
 * why the route's performance budget did not move for #405: the change below is markup.
 *
 * <h2>Daily volume reads left to right, because that is what a trend is — issue #405</h2>
 *
 * <p>It used to be thirty rows, one per day, each with a horizontal bar beside the figure.
 * Every number was on the screen and the shape was not: a reader comparing the fourth of
 * August with the twelfth was comparing two bar lengths eight rows apart, which is the one
 * arrangement that hides a series. Time runs along the axis now and the columns share a
 * baseline, so "volume fell after the fifteenth" is something somebody sees rather than
 * something they work out.
 *
 * <p><strong>Every figure is still readable, and not only as a length.</strong> Each column
 * carries its day and its amount as text for a screen reader, the axis is labelled with the
 * first and last day, and the busiest day is stated — CLAUDE.md's rule that colour must never
 * carry meaning applies to length in exactly the same way. What was removed is the
 * repetition, not the data.

 *
 * <p><strong>A day with nothing pledged is a column of no height and not a gap.</strong> A

 * fourteenth" is one of the observations somebody opens this screen for. Anything above zero
