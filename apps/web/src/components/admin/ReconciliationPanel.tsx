/**
 * §4.11's AD-05: do the platform's books add up? — issue #106.
 *
 * <h2>Three things this screen must never do</h2>
 *
 * <strong>It must not present "never run" as "balanced".</strong> A reconciliation that
 * silently stopped produces an empty finding list, which is exactly what a healthy platform
 * produces. The service answers `hasRun`, and the panel leads with it: a platform nobody has
 * checked is a finding of its own, and it is the one somebody is least likely to notice.
 *
 * <p><strong>It must not say "balanced" in green and leave it at that.</strong> CLAUDE.md
 * §2 — colour alone never carries meaning, and a screen whose entire content is a status is
 * where that rule is most expensive to break. Every state here is a sentence first.
 *
 * <p><strong>It must not offer to fix anything.</strong> `LedgerReconciliation` reports and
 * never repairs, because the correcting entry depends on which of a dozen things went wrong
 * and a job that guessed would turn a detectable problem into an undetectable one. There is
 * therefore no "resolve" control on this screen, and the absence is the design.
 *
 * <h2>The success colour is `--success`, and it is never lime</h2>
 *
 * CLAUDE.md §2: lime means "act now", not "this went well". Books that balance are the
 * opposite of an outstanding task, and lime here would tell a member of finance the reverse
 * of the truth on the one screen where that matters most. `InlineAlert`'s variants carry the
 * icon that goes with each, so the state reads without the colour at all.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * `docs/motion-system.md` §5 gives the console no entry animation. Nothing here fades in,
 * and "Check again" swaps a label rather than animating.
