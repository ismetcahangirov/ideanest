/**
 * The one place a curation change is committed — AD-03, issues #300 to #303.
 *
 * <h2>The note is required, and that is the service's rule rather than this file's</h2>
 *
 * Publishing a collection, withdrawing one, adding a campaign and removing one all carry
 * `minLength: 1` on their note in the contract. The reason is worth repeating where somebody
 * is typing: in a badge-granting collection, adding a campaign <strong>is</strong> §3.2's
 * "apply an editorial badge" — a decision about which campaigns the platform itself stands
 * behind, audited, and one somebody may have to justify a year later.
 *
 * <p>Checked here as well as in the service so that a curator is told before the request
 * rather than by a 400 after it. `lib/moderation/api.ts` states the same principle for the
 * moderation notes, which are optional for the opposite reason: nothing shows those to
 * anybody, so requiring one would produce a field people type "ok" into.
 *
 * <h2>A dialog rather than an inline form</h2>
 *
 * The same argument `DecisionDialog` makes: every one of these verbs is privileged and
 * audited, and `Modal` is the only overlay in the kit that traps focus and returns it to the
 * control that opened it (docs/ui-kit.md §7.14). Backdrop dismissal is off — a curator has to
 * choose — and Escape stays on, because cancelling is one of the two choices.
 *
 * <h2>Motion</h2>
 *
 * The modal's own 200ms entry and nothing else, which collapses to an instant state change
 * under `prefers-reduced-motion` (docs/motion-system.md §4.11.1).
