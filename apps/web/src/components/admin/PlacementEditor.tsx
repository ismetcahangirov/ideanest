/**
 * §4.11's AD-03: where a curated collection appears — issue #303.
 *
 * <h2>What placement is, given that there is no placement table</h2>
 *
 * §4.13's WS-04 makes the home page "the only page whose content is entirely editorial", and
 * AD-03 is what decides it. The mechanism is one integer: `collections.sort_order`, which
 * orders the collections index and the rails built from it. Lower is earlier, and the
 * published ones are what a visitor meets.
 *
 * <p>That is less than the issue's title suggests, and the screen says so rather than
 * implying a slot editor that does not exist. There is no endpoint that puts a named
 * collection in a named position on a named page — placement today is the order of one list —
 * and inventing a richer interface over an integer would be an interface that stops working
 * the moment somebody builds the real thing.
 *
 * <h2>Move up and move down, not a number to type</h2>
 *
 * A curator's question is "put this above that", not "what integer is that". Two buttons make
 * that expressible without anybody having to know what the current numbers are, or that they
 * are allowed to have gaps.
 *
 * <p><strong>A move is two requests, and the screen says when it has done one of them.</strong>
 * The endpoint replaces one collection at a time, so swapping two positions is two `PUT`s.
 * They are sent in sequence and the second failing leaves the first applied — which is a real
 * state, not a bug to hide: the list is then in an order somebody did not ask for, and the
 * honest response is to say so and re-read rather than to guess at a rollback the API cannot
 * make atomic.
 *
 * <h2>Unpublished collections are shown and are not hidden from the order</h2>
 *
 * They occupy a position and will take it the moment they are published. A placement editor
 * that showed only the published ones would let somebody arrange six rails and then be
 * surprised by a seventh.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * The rows do not animate as they move. docs/motion-system.md §8 rules out animation in lists,
 * and a reorder that slid would be 300ms in which the next button cannot be aimed at — on a
 * screen whose whole interaction is pressing the same button repeatedly.
