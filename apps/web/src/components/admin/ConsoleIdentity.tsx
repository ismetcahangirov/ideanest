/**
 * How the console says who or what something is — issue #402.
 *
 * <h2>The defect these three components close</h2>
 *
 * The console identified people, campaigns, pledges and categories by eight hexadecimal
 * characters and then asked the operator to type the other twenty-eight from memory. One
 * workflow could not be finished because of it: `/admin/staff` asks for a full account
 * identifier "from the account directory", and `/admin/users` displayed no identifier
 * anywhere, had no copy control and no clickable row.
 *
 * <p>So there are exactly three things here, and each closes one half of that:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link EntityName} renders a name where the console rendered a fragment, with the
 *       fragment kept beside it — the identifier is what somebody quotes to an engineer, so
 *       replacing it outright would trade one missing fact for another.
 *   <li>{@link CopyIdentifier} puts the whole identifier on the clipboard, which removes the
 *       dead end on its own: five screens ask for a UUID typed by hand, and every one of
 *       them is now reachable from the screen that supplies it.
 *   <li>{@link Identifier} is the fragment on its own, for the rows where there is no name
 *       to resolve — a transaction, a posting, an idempotency key.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Colour is never the signal</h2>
 *
 * CLAUDE.md: colour alone must never carry meaning. Copying answers with a word rather than
 * a flash of green, and the word is announced — an operator who has just copied an account
 * identifier is about to paste it into a field that grants somebody the authority to move
 * money, and "did that work" is not a question to answer by looking closely.
 *
 * <h2>Motion</h2>
 *
 * None beyond the 150ms of colour docs/motion-system.md §5 gives an administrative control.
 * The confirmation appears and disappears; nothing moves.

 * and added a different gap. The name leads because that is what a human is looking for.
 *
 * <p><strong>A name that has not resolved renders exactly what this screen rendered
 * before.</strong> The lookup is a second read and is allowed to fail; when it does, or
 * before it answers, the row is the eight-character fragment it always was. Nothing here
 * renders a skeleton: a queue that shimmered in twenty places while its names arrived would
 * be a screen that looks broken every time it loads.
 *
 * <p><strong>The link is only ever a real one.</strong> A campaign with no public path — one
 * in review, which is exactly the case a moderation queue holds — gets a name and no link,
 * because half a path resolves to no route at all. That is the 404 #399 is about, and this
