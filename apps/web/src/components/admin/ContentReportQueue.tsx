/**
 * §4.11's AD-09: complaints about what people wrote — issue #297.
 *
 * <h2>What was actually blocking this</h2>
 *
 * #297 said updates had no report route, "so half the queue has no intake" — and the
 * taxonomy agreed: `ReportTargetType.PROJECT_UPDATE` carried a comment saying nothing could
 * write it, because `project_updates` did not exist.
 *
 * Both stopped being true. #83 built the table, and #297 added the check, the
 * `ReportTargets` branch and `POST /v1/updates/{id}/report` — with no migration at all,
 * because V23&apos;s constraint had named the value since #102. That bet has now paid off
 * twice: comments arrived the same way with #84.
 *
 * <h2>Two chips over one queue, not two pages</h2>
 *
 * `/admin/moderation/profiles` is a page of its own because a complaint about a person leads
 * to a different decision — a ban revokes every session somebody holds. Comments and updates
 * do not: both are things somebody wrote on a campaign, both are decided with the same two
 * outcomes, and a moderator working one is working the other in the same sitting. Splitting
 * them across two routes would mean checking two queues to find out whether there is
 * anything to do.
 *
 * <p>The chip is a real filter rather than a browser-side narrowing, which is the correction
 * #298 made: it changes the query the service is asked, so paging continues within the
 * surface rather than running out at the end of whichever twenty-five rows were loaded.
 *
 * <h2>Deciding a report does not remove what was reported</h2>
 *
 * The same note the profile queue carries, and it is here for the same reason: it is the
 * thing moderators get wrong. Upholding a complaint about a comment records a judgement;
 * taking the comment down is a separate action on the campaign, by somebody who can see it
 * in context.
