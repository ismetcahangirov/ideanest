/**
 * The collection index, loaded once per screen — AD-03, issues #300 to #303.
 *
 * <h2>Why a hook and not four copies of the same effect</h2>
 *
 * Four screens read the same endpoint and differ only in which collections they draw and what
 * they let a curator change: the manager lists everything, the badge screen the ones that
 * grant a badge, the open-call screen the ones with a window, the placement editor the order.
 * The loading, the abort on unmount, the four refusal states and the "put the service's answer
 * back" rule are identical in all four, and four copies of that is three places for the next
 * fix to miss.
 *
 * <h2>`apply` replaces a row wholesale and never merges into it</h2>
 *
 * Every curation mutation returns the collection as the service now holds it. Merging a guess
 * into local state is how a screen ends up showing a badge that was not granted: the request
 * that publishes a collection can also change its `sortOrder`, and a client that patched only
 * the field it thought it was changing would keep the stale one.
 *
 * <h2>No optimistic updates anywhere in this module</h2>
 *
 * Same rule the moderation queue and the account directory follow, and for the same reason:
 * these are privileged, audited changes that another curator can be making at the same moment.
 * A row that flips before the service answers is an interface that lies for a few hundred
 * milliseconds about which campaigns the platform is standing behind.
 *
 * @param subject what the screen calls the thing it is reading, already translated — the four
 *     screens say different things, and the refusal is the one message a reader meets without
 *     having done anything wrong
 * @param refusals the console's refusal table, resolved on the server by the route
