/**
 * Finds the account a form is about, by name or address — issue #402.
 *
 * <h2>The dead end this removes</h2>
 *
 * `/admin/staff` asks for a full account identifier and its help text names where to get
 * one: "from the account directory". `/admin/users` <em>is</em> the account directory, and
 * it rendered no identifier anywhere in a row, had no copy control and no link. So the
 * identifier the form required was not obtainable from the screen the form named, and the
 * only routes to it were the database or the API. Granting a staff role could not be
 * completed inside the console at all.
 *
 * <p>#402 offers two ways out and says which to do first: make every identifier copyable, or
 * replace the fields with a search-and-pick control. Both are here, and this is the second —
 * for the one field where it is not optional, because a role grant is the workflow that was
 * impossible rather than merely tedious.
 *
 * <h2>Why here and not on the other five fields</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the account directory is searchable and the campaign directory is not. Search
 * over campaigns is #404's, and building half a picker over a list that only pages would be
 * a control that looks like it can find things and cannot. Those five fields keep their text
 * input and gain a copy control on the screen that supplies the identifier, which is #402's
 * own first choice.
 *
 * <h2>Searching is an audited read, so it happens when asked</h2>
 *
 * <p>`GET /v1/admin/users` hands over email addresses and writes an
 * {@code ACCOUNTS_SEARCHED} row for every call. A search-as-you-type control would put one
 * of those in the audit trail per keystroke, on the one table with no retention rule — so
 * this searches when the reader submits, and says so. That is also why the field is a plain
 * text input rather than a `Combobox`: the kit's combobox is an as-you-type control, and
 * dressing a deliberate search as one would be a promise the audit rule cannot keep.
 *
 * <h2>What it hands back</h2>
 *
 * <p>The whole account, not the identifier. The caller renders the name it picked, so the
 * confirmation of "who am I about to make an administrator" is a person rather than
 * thirty-six characters that were correct when they were pasted.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5: an administrative surface gets 150ms of colour on a control and
 * nothing that moves. This one decides who may move money.
