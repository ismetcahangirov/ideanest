 * The two refusals every console screen can meet before it has anything to draw.

 * <p><strong>`variant="info"` and not `danger`, for both.</strong> Neither is an error in the
 * sense a red panel means: a session that expired is ordinary, and an account without the
 * authority for a screen has not done anything wrong by opening a URL somebody sent it. Red
 * here would be the interface shouting at somebody for a thing it is itself responsible for.
 *
 * <p>Returns null for the other three statuses, so a caller can render it unconditionally and
 * keep its own branch for the states that have content.
 *
 * <h2>The forbidden branch is two refusals — #400</h2>
 *
 * <p>`StaffDirectory.requireCapability` answers a stranger and a colleague differently on
 * purpose, and its own comment says why: "collapsing them would send a moderator who opened
 * the refund console looking for a bug". That is exactly what this component did, because it
 * had the status and not the cause — every screen resolved a 403 to the string `forbidden`
 * and the capability the service had put in `meta` was dropped on the floor between the catch
 * and the render.
 *
 * <p>So the capability travels as a prop beside the status. `useConsoleResource` carries it
 * for the screens that use it; the six that predate that hook keep it in state next to their
 * own.
 *
 * <h2>This was the last component that could not be translated, and why it can be now</h2>
 *
 * `apps/web/README.md` used to list this file as the exception: the signed-out sentence names
 * the thing a screen was about to show, the noun comes from the screen, and while the screens
 * were English literals there was no translated noun to put in it. Every screen carries a
 * catalogue node since #324, so `subject` arrives already translated and already inflected for
 * its position, and the sentence is a template around it rather than a concatenation.
