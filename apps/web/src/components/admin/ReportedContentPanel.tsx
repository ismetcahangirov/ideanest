/**
 * What the report is about — issue #399.
 *
 * <h2>The block this page spent its whole life without</h2>
 *
 * `/admin/moderation/{id}` rendered the reason, the reporter's claim, an identifier for the
 * reporter, and two irreversible buttons. Counted in the DOM: zero links in `<main>`. A
 * moderator was asked to uphold or dismiss a complaint about a comment they could not read,
 * written by somebody they could not identify, on a campaign they could not name.
 *
 * <p>What follows from that is not "the screen is thin". It is that the queue cannot be
 * worked honestly: upholding a report you cannot read is the riskier of the two decisions,
 * so the fast safe path is to dismiss everything — and a moderation queue that is always
 * dismissed looks, from every dashboard, exactly like one that is being worked.
 *
 * <h2>Four answers, because the platform can be in four positions</h2>
 *
 * The state is what this branches on, and each branch says something a moderator acts on
 * differently. `REMOVED` is the one that matters most: the text is still shown, because a
 * report filed before the removal still has to be decidable, and the notice above it is what
 * stops the same comment being taken down twice or somebody being banned for a comment a
 * colleague has already handled.
 *
 * <h2>Everything here is untrusted text</h2>
 *
 * The body is what one member of the public wrote about another, arriving on a screen
 * operated by staff. It is rendered as text — never as markup, and never through
 * `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` — for the reason `CampaignStory` gives about a public page and
 * one more: this is the surface where hostile content is expected rather than possible.
 *
 * <h2>Motion</h2>
 *
 * None. The detail page's whole budget is the decision dialog's 200ms entry, and this block
 * is below it.
