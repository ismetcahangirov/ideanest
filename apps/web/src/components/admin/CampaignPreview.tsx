/**
 * A campaign as its page reads, for the moderator deciding it — issue #399.
 *
 * <h2>The screen the submission queue was asking for a decision without</h2>
 *
 * `/admin/moderation/submissions` lists campaigns awaiting review with Approve, Request
 * changes and Reject, and the campaign's title was the one link on each card. It pointed at
 * the public page. A campaign in review is not public — that is what being in review means —
 * so the link answered 404 by construction, and the decision was taken on a title, a
 * creator's name and a goal figure. The two thousand words the creator actually wrote were
 * one screen away and reachable by nobody.
 *
 * <h2>The same page a backer would see, and that is the requirement</h2>
 *
 * The service serves this from `PublicProjectPages` — the identical projection the public
 * campaign page is served from — and the story is rendered by {@link CampaignStory}, the
 * identical component. A moderator decides whether a campaign may be published, so what
 * they are shown has to be what publishing it would show. A purpose-built summary would be
 * a second description of the campaign, and the decision would be taken against the summary.
 *
 * <h2>It says what it is, at the top, before anything else</h2>
 *
 * This renders drafts. A draft is a private working document its creator has shown nobody,
 * and a member of staff who has forgotten which screen they are on is one screenshot away
 * from a problem. The notice is not decoration and it is not dismissible.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing here changes anything</h2>
 *
 * No approve, no reject, no suspend. The three moderation outcomes live on the queue where
 * the campaign's own state and the waiting time are in view, and suspension is its own
 * screen with its own confirmation. A preview that also carried decisions would be a second
 * path into a state machine whose single path is the reason the transition service exists —
 * and the queue is deliberately opened in a new tab from here, so it and its filters survive
 * the trip.
 *
 * <h2>Motion</h2>
 *
 * None. docs/motion-system.md §8 forbids animation in long content outright: a paragraph
 * that fades in as it is scrolled past is a paragraph somebody is trying to read, and this
 * page is two thousand words of somebody trying to be read.
