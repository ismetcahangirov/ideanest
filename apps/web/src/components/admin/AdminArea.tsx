/**
 * The frame every console screen renders inside — §4.11 and §4.13 WS-01, issue #294.
 *
 * <h2>Its own shell, and not the site's</h2>
 *
 * `app/(site)/layout.tsx` said this was coming and said why in one line: "the admin console
 * gets its own shell". Two reasons, and the second is the one worth measuring.
 *
 * <strong>The public header is the wrong chrome.</strong> It offers Discover, the categories,
 * search, "Start a project" and an account menu. A member of staff clearing a report queue
 * wants none of those, and a header whose most prominent control invites them to start a
 * campaign is a header designed for somebody else.
 *
 * <strong>And it is not free.</strong> `MinimalShell` records the measurement:
 * `SiteHeader` reaches `@ideanest/ui`'s root barrel for `TopBar`, `useDismiss` and
 * `useFocusTrap`, and a barrel in a `transpilePackages` source package lands in one shared
 * chunk — 83.3 KiB of it, the last time somebody put `SiteShell` somewhere it did not
 * belong. The console has eleven routes and would have paid that eleven times over for a
 * navigation bar it does not use.
 *
 * <h2>Why not `MinimalShell`, then</h2>
 *
 * Because a console is not a sign-in page. `MinimalShell` is a wordmark and a `<main>`, which
 * is right for a screen with one job and wrong for a surface somebody moves around inside
 * several times in a sitting. What this adds over it is exactly the rail, and the rail is
 * the whole of #294.
 *
 * <h2>One `<main>`, and it is here</h2>
 *
 * The two screens that existed before this each declared their own, because there was no
 * shell to be inside; both lost it in the same change that added this file. Two `<main>`
 * elements is not a duplicated landmark so much as an ambiguous one — assistive technology
 * offers "jump to main" and there is now more than one answer. `AccountArea` made the same
 * correction to `/settings/sessions` and `/settings/notifications`.
 *
 * <h2>The rail is beside the content, not above it</h2>
 *
 * docs/ui-kit.md §6.3 puts a rail on the left of a working surface, and a console is the
 * definition of one: ten destinations somebody moves between while holding one complaint in
 * their head. Above the content it would push every screen down and would compete with the
 * bar a few pixels above it.
 *
 * <h2>It says who <em>is</em> looking, and still gates nothing — issue #405</h2>
 *
 * <strong>`ConsoleReader` is a statement, not a check.</strong> The bar named neither the
 * reader nor their authority, so somebody moving between screens could not tell a screen
 * that was not theirs from one that was broken — on a surface where a machine and a shift
 * are shared. That is a sentence the console can now say, because #295 gave it
 * `GET /v1/admin/me` and #402 gave it somewhere to turn an identifier into a name.
 *
 * <p>It changes nothing about the paragraph below, which is still the rule: the line renders
 * what the service told the browser, the service refuses every read behind every screen
 * regardless of what the line says, and a reader who is not staff gets no line rather than a
 * refusal — because the console index already says that in a sentence, and a shell is the
 * wrong place to tell somebody they do not work here.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing here says who may be looking</h2>
 *
 * <strong>The route is not a gate, and must not become one.</strong> There is no role model
 * in the schema or in the access token until epic #100, so every endpoint the console calls
 * refuses a caller who is not on the configured moderator list, and each screen renders that
 * refusal. A check here would be a second, weaker copy of one the service already makes
 * correctly, and the two would eventually disagree — the dangerous direction being the one
 * where this file says yes. The two screens that predate the console carry the same note,
 * and #295 is the issue that replaces the list with something a client could honestly read.
 *
 * <h2>Motion</h2>
 *
 * None. docs/motion-system.md §5 gives an administrative surface the same budget as account
 * settings — 150ms of colour on a control, and nothing that moves.
