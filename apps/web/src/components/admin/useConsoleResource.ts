/**
 * The load-and-refuse dance every console screen does, written once — issues #295 to #316.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists now and did not before</h2>
 *
 * The nine screens of the first half of this epic each wrote out the same effect by hand:
 * open an `AbortController`, set `loading`, await a read, bail if aborted, branch the
 * failure into `signed-out` / `forbidden` / `failed`, and abort on cleanup. That was
 * defensible at nine — `lib/admin/refusals.ts` already argued that nine near-identical
 * `messageFor` functions was the point at which the eighth copy is the one somebody forgets
 * to update.
 *
 * This epic's second half adds twelve more. Twenty-one hand-written copies of an effect
 * whose subtle part is "an abort is not a failure" is twenty-one chances to paint
 * "something went wrong" over a screen that is loading correctly.
 *
 * <h2>What it deliberately does not do</h2>
 *
 * **It does not cache, dedupe, or retry.** Every one of those would be a policy applied to
 * screens that read different things for different reasons — a stale ledger and a stale
 * queue depth are not equally harmless — and this file has no way to tell them apart. It is
 * the effect, not a data layer.
 *
 * **It does not own mutations.** A screen that grants a role or issues a refund calls the
 * client directly and decides for itself what to do with the result, because the interesting
 * part of a write is always the part that is specific to it.
