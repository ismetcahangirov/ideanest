/**
 * How a server render learns which language to draw — issues #324 and #123,
 * docs/architecture.md §21.1.
 *
 * <h2>This file used to read a cookie, and the change is the whole of #123</h2>
 *
 * The previous version negotiated the language from `ideanest_locale`, and the docblock it
 * carried was mostly an apology for what that cost: `cookies()` marks a render dynamic, so
 * only the account area — authenticated, per-person, dynamic already — could afford to be
 * translated. `/`, the category landings and the static pages were left in English literals
 * because translating their shell would have turned every cached read into a per-request
 * render, and the bill would have arrived on the largest contentful paint of the pages a
 * stranger meets first.
 *
 * That trade is gone rather than improved. The language is a path segment now, so
 * `requestLocale` resolves from the route's own `[locale]` parameter — a value the router
 * already knows before this function is called, that no header or cookie was read to learn,
 * and that leaves the render as static as it was. `/az/discover` and `/ru/discover` are two
 * cached documents instead of one dynamic one.
 *
 * The consequence worth stating plainly: **there is no longer a performance argument for
 * leaving any surface in English.** `middleware.ts` owns the one remaining cookie read, on
 * the bare path only, where a redirect is the whole response.
 *
 * <h2>Trusting `requestLocale`, and still checking it</h2>
 *
 * The value arrives from the matched route segment, and `generateStaticParams` only ever
 * produces the four. It is still validated, because a `[locale]` segment is a wildcard —
 * `/xx/discover` matches the route before it fails anything — and the line below feeds a
 * dynamic import. An unchecked value there is an attacker-chosen path into the module
 * graph, which is a different class of problem from a page in the wrong language.
