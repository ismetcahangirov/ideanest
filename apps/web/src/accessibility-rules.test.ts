/**
 * The two rules from §9 that no rendered test can see — issue #129.
 *
 * <h2>Why these are static scans</h2>
 *
 * Both catch defects that are invisible in a rendered tree. A `<div onClick={…}>` looks and
 * behaves correctly for anybody using a mouse, and axe does not flag it either: there is no
 * ARIA violation in a `<div>` that happens to have a listener, and a rule that guessed would
 * fire on every card with a hover effect. Colour is worse — jsdom computes no styles at all,
 * so every automated contrast rule is inert under this test runner.
 *
 * <p>They also cover every component in the application rather than the ones somebody
 * remembered to write a test for. The rendered passes in the flow suites cover the three
 * surfaces #129 names; these cover the rest, cheaply, for ever.
 *
 * <p>The arithmetic that decides which token is legible on which surface is
 * `packages/ui/src/contrast.test.ts`, beside the token file it reads. This is the other half:
 * whether the tokens that came out of it are used for what they are for.
