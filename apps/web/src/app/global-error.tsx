/**
 * The boundary of last resort — §4.13 WS-09, issue #263.
 *
 * <h2>This is the one failure state that is NOT inside the shell, and cannot be</h2>
 *
 * `global-error.tsx` catches a throw in the ROOT LAYOUT itself, which means the root layout
 * did not render — so it replaces the whole document and has to supply its own `<html>` and
 * `<body>`. There is no `SessionProvider` above it, so `SiteHeader` would throw on
 * `useSession` the moment it mounted; a shell rendered here would be a second uncaught error
 * inside the handler for the first, which is how a blank page happens.
 *
 * §4.13 asks for the failure states to keep the shell and `not-found.tsx` and `error.tsx` do.
 * This one cannot, and the honest version is a page that stands entirely on its own.
 *
 * <h2>So it depends on nothing</h2>
 *
 * No component import, no `@ideanest/ui`, no Tailwind class that a missing stylesheet would
 * make meaningless. **The colours are inline and they are literals**, which is the one place
 * in this repository that is true: `packages/ui/src/design-tokens.test.ts` fails a build for a
 * hex literal in a component, and the reason it exists — every colour comes from
 * `@ideanest/design-tokens` — assumes a stylesheet that has loaded. This file runs when the
 * document itself failed, so a `var(--surface-1)` here would resolve to nothing and render
 * black-on-black. The values are `--surface-1` and `--text-primary` exactly, and the test's
 * scope is `packages/ui`.
 *
 * `lang` comes from the same constant the root layout uses, so the two cannot drift.
