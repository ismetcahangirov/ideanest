/**
 * `/verify-email` — §4.1 A-02, issue #270.
 *
 * <h2>This is the address the verification email points at</h2>
 *
 * The service issues the token and the message that carries it (`RegistrationService` publishes
 * `EmailVerificationRequested`); the link in that message resolves against
 * `ideanest.notification.email.base-url`, which is this application's origin. So the contract
 * between the two halves is this path and the name of one query parameter, `token`, and it is
 * written down in `apps/web/README.md`'s route table as well as here.
 *
 * <h2>The `Suspense` boundary is required</h2>
 *
 * `VerifyEmailView` reads the token with `useSearchParams`. Without a boundary Next refuses to
 * statically render the route, and this one is worth rendering statically: it is a shell whose
 * only dynamic input arrives in the browser's own URL.
 *
 * `noindex` for the reason the sign-in page gives, and with one more of its own — the URL
 * carries a single-use credential, and nothing that carries a credential should be in an
 * index.
