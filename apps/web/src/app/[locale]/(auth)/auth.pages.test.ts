/**
 * The six screens somebody meets before they have an account — issue #324.
 *
 * <h2>What this covers that the catalogue test does not</h2>
 *
 * `lib/i18n/catalogue.test.ts` asserts properties of the messages and cannot see whether a
 * *page* asks for any of them: a route rewritten with a literal back in it passes every
 * catalogue check while showing English to everybody. `account-area.pages.test.ts` makes the
 * same argument for the signed-in screens and this is its counterpart for the public half.
 *
 * <h2>Why these routes deserve their own guard</h2>
 *
 * They are the first pages a stranger sees, and the only ones somebody who cannot get in can
 * reach. A key that was never added renders as `auth.signIn.submit` under
 * `getMessageFallback`, and on this route that is the label of the button somebody has to
 * press to reach their pledges. Everywhere else in the application a missing string is a
 * blemish; here it is a locked door.
 *
 * <p>It reads the pages' own source rather than rendering them. Each one is a server component
 * that awaits a copy accessor and hands the object to a client form, and a test that mounted
 * it would be a test of the mock behind `next-intl/server`.
