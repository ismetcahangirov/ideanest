/**
 * The public profile — §4.2 P-04 to P-07, at `/u/{slug}`. Issue #274.
 *
 * <h2>Server-rendered, and the 404 is the reason</h2>
 *
 * `lib/profiles/server.ts` carries the full argument. In short: an unknown slug, a closed
 * account and a private profile are one answer, and that answer is only worth anything if it
 * arrives as a **404 status**. A client-rendered page has already sent 200 by the time it can
 * know, so the best it could manage is not-found text under a successful response — a soft
 * 404, which a crawler indexes and goes on requesting. `notFound()` here sends the real thing,
 * and `app/u/not-found.tsx` is what it renders.
 *
 * The same read produces the page and its `<head>`, and it is one request: Next deduplicates
 * `fetch` within a render and both calls go through the same Data Cache entry, exactly as the
 * campaign page relies on.
 *
 * <h2>Both lists are fetched here, and neither is fetched again in the browser</h2>
 *
 * The created list and the backed archive are two requests on the server, both cached for the
 * minute every public read in this application is. A tab that fetched on activation would save
 * a request for the visitor who never opens it and would cost a loading state inside a widget
 * somebody has just pressed a key to reach — and it would leave a crawler, which fires no
 * clicks, reading a profile with one of its two lists missing.
 *
 * `ProfileCampaignGrid` is handed those pages as a seed and only ever asks for what comes
 * after them.
 *
 * <h2>A list that could not be read is not an empty list</h2>
 *
 * `null` from either reader is the service refusing or being unreachable, and the panel says
 * so. Printing "no campaigns yet" over a restarting service would tell a reader something
 * false about a person, which is worse on a profile than almost anywhere else.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * Not a budget line so much as an absence of anything to reveal. docs/motion-system.md §8
 * forbids animating a list of cards, the tab panels are already in the document, and the one
 * `FadeUp` this system allows on a first screen would here be a heading fading in over content
 * that arrived with it.

/**
 * What the page says about itself.
 *
 * A profile that cannot be read gets `privatePageMetadata`: `noindex`, `nofollow`, no
 * canonical and **no Open Graph block at all**. That last part is the point rather than
 * tidiness — without it, a link to a hidden profile pasted into a chat would unfurl as an
 * IdeaNest card and imply there is somebody behind it, which is the leak the 404 exists to
 * prevent, restated in a preview image.
 *
 * The description is the biography when there is one and a plain sentence when there is not.
 * It is never the counts: a social card is cached by every unfurler that renders it, so a
 * number in one is a number that will be wrong (`PublicProjectPreview` makes the same rule).

 * total **exactly when there is no next cursor**, and a fraction of it otherwise. A single
 * page is therefore counted and a paginated one is not, rather than the tab printing "24"
 * beside a creator with two hundred campaigns. A wrong number is not a smaller version of the
 * right one; it is a number a reader cannot tell apart from a right one.

 * `@ideanest/ui` barrel, which pulls `createContext` into the server graph and fails
 * `next build` naming a component the page never used (`packages/ui/src/server.ts`).
