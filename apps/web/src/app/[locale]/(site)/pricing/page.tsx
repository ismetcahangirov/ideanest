/**
 * `/pricing` — what a creator pays to publish.
 *
 * <h2>Public, and indexed</h2>
 *
 * Unlike every other page about somebody's money on this platform, this one is for strangers:
 * a creator deciding whether to bring their campaign here reads it before they have an
 * account, and it is the page the marketing site links to. So `publicPageMetadata` rather than
 * `privatePageMetadata`, and the catalogue is read on the server where a shared cache can hold
 * it.
 *
 * <h2>`?from=submit&project=` is what a refused submission adds</h2>
 *
 * The campaign editor navigates here when a submission is refused for want of a plan, and the
 * two parameters are what let this page explain itself: a banner saying why the reader is
 * looking at a price list, and a link back to the campaign they were in the middle of.
 * Without them somebody arrives at a page of prices with no account of what they did to
 * deserve it.
 *
 * <p>`project` is passed to a link and to nothing else — it is never fetched, never trusted,
 * and a value naming a campaign that does not exist produces a link that 404s rather than
 * anything worse.
 *
 * <h2>Reading `searchParams` makes this route dynamic, and that is accepted</h2>
 *
 * The alternative is a static shell that reads the parameters in the client, which would mean
 * the banner appearing a frame after the page — on the one screen where the reader's first
 * question is "why am I here". The catalogue read behind it is still cached for an hour and
 * shared by everybody, so what is paid for is a render rather than a round trip.
