/**
 * `/legal/{document}/v/{version}` — the archive. Issue #439.
 *
 * <h2>Why this route exists at all</h2>
 *
 * #439: "An archive matters more than it looks — somebody who accepted version 3 must be able to
 * read version 3, not only whatever is current." Without it, `document_acceptances` names a text
 * the person it is about cannot see, which makes the record evidence of nothing they could
 * check. V65 stores every version precisely so this address can exist, and the trigger that
 * makes a published version immutable is what makes it worth having.
 *
 * <h2>Not prerendered, and still not dynamic in the sense that matters</h2>
 *
 * There is no {@link generateStaticParams} here: the set of versions grows whenever somebody
 * publishes, and enumerating it would mean this route knowing how many there are at build time —
 * which is exactly the coupling that produces a deploy where version 5 is a 404. Next renders
 * the first request for a version and caches it; every subsequent reader gets the cached page.
 * The read still carries no credentials and no cookie, so nothing about it varies per reader.
 *
 * <h2>`noindex`, and that is the one place this differs from the current version</h2>
 *
 * An archived version is superseded text. A search engine that indexed both would rank whichever
 * had more links, and the address a reader arrives at from a search would be the terms that
 * stopped applying in March. `privatePageMetadata` is `noindex, nofollow` with no canonical —
 * the current version is the indexable one, and this page links to it in as many words.
 *
 * It stays perfectly reachable by anybody following a link from their own acceptance record,
 * which is who it is for.

/**
 * A version number, or nothing.
 *
 * Integers from one, and `Number.parseInt` is not used: it reads `3abc` as 3, so `/v/3abc` would
 * quietly serve version 3 at an address that is not one this application generates. A crawler
 * that found such a URL would index a duplicate.
