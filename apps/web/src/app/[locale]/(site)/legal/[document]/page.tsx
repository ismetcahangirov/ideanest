/**
 * `/legal/{document}` — §22.2's eight documents, in force. Issue #439.
 *
 * <h2>Static, in the sense this application means it</h2>
 *
 * #439: "these are the pages a stranger and a regulator read, they change a few times a year,
 * and rendering them per request would be a dynamic route for no reason. No client provider, no
 * cookie read."
 *
 * <strong>Every route in this application builds as `ƒ`</strong>, `/about` and `/trust-safety`
 * included — the locale proxy sees to that — so "static" here is not a claim about the build
 * output. It is a claim about what a render depends on, and that is the part that matters: this
 * page reads no cookie, no header and no `searchParams`, so every reader in a language gets the
 * same bytes and one render serves all of them. A page that read a session would be one no
 * shared cache could hold, which is what the requirement is really about.
 *
 * {@link generateStaticParams} names the eight addresses for the same reason the locale layout
 * names the four languages: without it, the first visitor to each pays for a render, and the
 * first visitor is usually a crawler. `lib/legal/server.ts` reads with `next.revalidate` and no
 * credentials, so the answer behind those renders is shared too.
 *
 * The copy comes from `getTranslations`, resolved on the server. **No `NextIntlClientProvider`**:
 * one in a shared layout added up to 27.4 KiB to every route in its group, and these pages have
 * no interactivity to hydrate for.
 *
 * <h2>Eight addresses, and an unknown one is a real 404</h2>
 *
 * The segment is narrowed against §22.2's closed set before anything else happens. A ninth
 * document is a change to that specification rather than a URL somebody can type, so
 * `/legal/anything-else` is `notFound()` — which is different from a document that exists and
 * has not been published yet, and that difference is the whole of `LegalDocumentPage`'s
 * not-published branch.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: none</h2>
 *
 * `StaticPage` records the reasoning for the three content pages and it holds harder here.
 * `FadeUp` lives behind `@ideanest/ui/motion`, which is 116 kB of animation runtime, and these
 * are routes whose entire content is text somebody is reading because they are worried.
 */

/**
 * The eight, prerendered.
 *
 * Locales are not enumerated here: `[locale]` is the segment above and the app's own
 * configuration decides which languages are built. Returning the cross product would be this
 * route re-deciding §21.1.
