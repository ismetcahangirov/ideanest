/**
 * `/legal` — §22.2's eight, listed. Issue #439.
 *
 * <h2>Why an index rather than eight footer links</h2>
 *
 * §22.2 requires eight documents, and a footer column with eight entries is a footer nobody
 * reads. More importantly, this is the page a regulator lands on: one address that says what the
 * platform is required to have, which of those it has published, and since when. Eight scattered
 * links answer none of those questions in one place.
 *
 * <h2>It lists all eight, including the ones with nothing behind them</h2>
 *
 * <strong>This is the point of the page.</strong> The list is drawn from §22.2's closed set and
 * not from what the service returns, so a document that has never been published appears with
 * "not published yet" beside it rather than being silently absent. A platform that has not
 * published its creator agreement is a platform whose list is short, and hiding the gap would
 * make the page a claim that there are only six documents.
 *
 * That is this repository's actual state: the words are #423's adviser's and none of them exist
 * yet. The page says so rather than looking finished.
 *
 * <h2>Static in the sense this application means it</h2>
 *
 * The same conditions the document route lists, and its comment has the full argument: `params`
 * and no `searchParams`, a credential-free `fetch` with `next.revalidate`, and copy resolved on
 * the server through `getTranslations` rather than through a client provider. Nothing here
 * varies by reader, so one render serves everybody in a language.
