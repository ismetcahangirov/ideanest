/**
 * The error boundary for the public site — §4.13 WS-09, issue #263.
 *
 * <h2>Why it exists beside the root one</h2>
 *
 * Next uses the nearest boundary above the segment that threw, so this catches everything in
 * `app/(site)` and the root `app/error.tsx` catches the rest. The difference is the frame:
 * this one renders inside the group's layout and therefore keeps the whole header and footer,
 * which is what §4.13 asks for, and the root one uses `MinimalShell` because its imports reach
 * every route in the application — the measurement is in that component.
 *
 * A route in this group failing is most often one of the three server reads behind the home
 * page, a category page or the search results, and every one of those already answers `null`
 * rather than throwing (`lib/api/server.ts`). So this boundary is genuinely a last resort, and
 * `reset()` is genuinely the right first offer: what reaches it is the class of fault that
 * goes away by itself.
 *
 * Everything about what may and may not be printed — the message never, the digest always —
 * is the root boundary's comment, and it is not repeated here.
