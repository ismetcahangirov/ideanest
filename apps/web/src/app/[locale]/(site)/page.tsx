/**
 * `/` — §4.13 WS-04, issue #264.
 *
 * <h2>The route that did not exist</h2>
 *
 * Twenty routes shipped and the application answered its own origin with a 404. The sitemap
 * listed `/`, the breadcrumb trail on every campaign page started at `/`, `robots.txt`
 * allowed `/`, and none of them pointed at a page. This is that page.
 *
 * <h2>Server-rendered, and it has to be</h2>
 *
 * Nothing here is `'use client'` except one animation wrapper. WS-04 and WS-05 are, in
 * §4.13's own words, the two surfaces §11 and the SEO epic actually have to rank, and a home
 * page that assembled its campaigns in the browser would be a home page a crawler is served
 * empty. The same requirement #119 put on the campaign page and the feed.
 *
 * <h2>Three reads, and any of them may fail</h2>
 *
 * Ending soon, recently launched, and the taxonomy. Each answers `null` when the service
 * refuses or cannot be reached (`lib/api/server.ts`), and each section is simply absent when
 * its read produced nothing. A home page missing a rail is a home page; one that threw is a
 * platform that is down, and the difference is what a visitor arriving during a deployment
 * sees.
 *
 * When all three fail there is still a hero, still a header, still a footer, and still a link
 * to the feed — so the front door is never a dead end.
 *
 * <h2>Motion: the one Full budget on the platform</h2>
 *
 * docs/motion-system.md §5 gives "marketing home" a **Full** budget and adds a note saying
 * the row was aspirational because this route did not exist. It keeps Full, and Full is spent
 * with restraint: `FadeUp` on the hero and on each section heading, which is §5's own line
 * ("first screen and section headings"), and nothing on the cards, which §5.1 forbids
 * outright. No counters — the platform publishes no aggregate figure this page could honestly
 * count up to. No marquee and no page transition, both for the same reason: they would be
 * motion added because the budget allows it rather than because it says anything.
