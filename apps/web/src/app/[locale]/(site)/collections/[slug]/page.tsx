/**
 * `/collections/{slug}` — D-08's landing page, §4.13 WS-04. Issue #266.
 *
 * <h2>An indexable page per collection</h2>
 *
 * The URL is a path, not a query string, and that is the point twice over. A crawler cannot
 * operate a filter, and robots.txt disallows `/discover?` wholesale because the filters
 * compose into a combinatorial set of URLs over one corpus. But even a permitted filter would
 * not have been this page: what a collection is, is **an order somebody chose**, and there is
 * no parameter on `/v1/discover` that reproduces it.
 *
 * <h2>Everything that is not visible is a 404, and nothing here says which kind</h2>
 *
 * A slug that names nothing, a collection that has not been published, and one outside its own
 * window all reach `notFound()` through the same `null`. `CollectionController` argues it: a
 * 403 would confirm to anybody who guesses `/collections/spring-2027` that the platform is
 * preparing something under that name, which is a commercially interesting fact about its
 * plans. `lib/collections/landing.ts` holds the line and explains why a service that could not
 * be reached takes the same exit.
 *
 * `notFound()` rather than an empty page for the same reason `/categories/{category}` does: an
 * empty landing page for a slug that means nothing is a 200 that will be indexed, linked to,
 * and re-crawled forever.
 *
 * <h2>The metadata resolves the same collection the body does</h2>
 *
 * `generateMetadata` calls the same function the page does. Next dedupes the underlying
 * `fetch` within one request, so it is one round trip — and the two cannot disagree, which is
 * how a 404 body ends up under a real `<title>`, a canonical URL, and a social card for a page
 * nobody can open.
 *
 * <h2>The first page of campaigns is in the HTML</h2>
 *
 * The server render fetches page one and hands it to `CollectionCampaigns`, which appends
 * further pages in the browser and never re-requests the first. A crawler, a link unfurler and
 * a slow connection all get the campaigns rather than a skeleton; a reader who wants the rest
 * presses a button. `CollectionCampaigns` has the argument for paging here rather than handing
 * the reader off to the feed.
