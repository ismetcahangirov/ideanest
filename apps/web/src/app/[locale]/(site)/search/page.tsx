/**
 * `/search` — §4.13 WS-06, issue #262.
 *
 * <h2>Why a route of its own, when `/discover?q=` exists</h2>
 *
 * §4.13 draws the line: discovery's panel is a **refinement** surface and this is an **entry
 * point with its own URL**. The header's search field is on every page in the site, and what
 * it needs behind it is somewhere to land — a page whose whole content is "what matches this
 * phrase", reachable from a link somebody sent, with the results in the HTML.
 *
 * The two are not duplicates and they call different endpoints. This reads `GET /v1/search`,
 * which ranks by match quality and refuses a request with no phrase; discovery reads
 * `GET /v1/discover`, which takes a phrase as one narrowing among nine. What is shared is the
 * card, the parameter name, and the trip back: every result page offers the same search
 * inside the feed, one click away, where the filters are.
 *
 * <h2>`noindex`, and it is in `robots.txt` as well</h2>
 *
 * The URL space here is written by whoever types in the box, so every phrase anybody searches
 * for is a URL a crawler could be handed by a referrer log. `lib/seo/indexability.ts` already
 * disallows `/discover?` wholesale for that reason and `/search` is added beside it; the
 * `noindex, nofollow` here is the second lock, for the case where a crawler reaches the page
 * without reading robots.txt first.
 *
 * `nofollow` costs nothing that matters. Every campaign this page can link to is already in
 * the sitemap and on a category page, so there is no discovery path that only runs through a
 * search result.
 *
 * <h2>Rendered on the server, and dynamic on purpose</h2>
 *
 * Reading `searchParams` opts this route out of static rendering, which is correct: there is
 * no such thing as a prerendered answer to a phrase nobody has typed yet.
