/**
 * The title, description, canonical, and social card of one campaign's public
 * pre-launch page.
 *
 * **This is a link that goes into a social post.** That is the whole reason the
 * route exists outside `/edit`, and until now the page had a generic title —
 * "Coming soon" — for every campaign on the site, so every creator who shared
 * theirs shared a card that named somebody else's too. The comment that used to
 * sit here said a per-campaign title needed a server-rendered public projection
 * and left it to the campaign-page epic. It needed one fetch, not a rendered page,
 * and #120 is where it belongs.
 *
 * **The PAGE is still a client boundary and this changes nothing about that.**
 * `PrelaunchView` still reads the campaign in the browser through `publicFetch`,
 * because it also reads the follower count and posts the reminder. Server-rendering
 * the page itself is #119's. What happens here is a single anonymous read of the
 * public projection, for the `<head>` only.
 *
 * **A campaign that cannot be confirmed public gets no title, no description, and
 * `noindex`** — see `projectPageMetadata` and `fetchPublicProjectPreview`, which
 * each explain their half. The failure mode is a card that says nothing, never a
 * card that says something private.
