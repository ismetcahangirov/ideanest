/**
 * The dashboard's financial summary — §4.7's CD-16, issue 99.
 *
 * <p>A Server Component that renders a client one and fetches nothing, for the reason the
 * overview and charts pages give: the read is behind a bearer token, `lib/api/server.ts` sends
 * none by design, and the service answers `private, no-store` — this is one creator's view of
 * their own money, and there is nothing about it a shared render could produce.
 *
 * <p>The route is `finance` rather than `payouts`. A payout is one event in the answer; what a
 * creator came here for is where their money went, and the URL is the one thing on this screen
 * they might type.
