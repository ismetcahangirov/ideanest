/**
 * `/projects/{id}/back` — the pledge flow, docs/architecture.md §4.5.
 *
 * <h2>Why this segment</h2>
 *
 * **`back`, because that is what the person is doing.** The product's verb for
 * this is "Back this project" — it is the label on the call to action in
 * docs/motion-system.md §4.3 — and a route reads best when it names the reader's
 * intent rather than the system's process. `checkout` is our word for the
 * machinery and it borrows a shopping cart's mental model, which is wrong here in
 * a way that matters: nothing is bought, nothing is charged today, and the thing
 * at the end is a commitment that may never be collected (§9.2).
 *
 * It sits beside `edit/` and `prelaunch/` under `projects/[id]`, which keeps the
 * three audiences of one campaign in one place: `edit` is the creator's, and
 * `prelaunch` and `back` are the public's.
 *
 * <h2>One route, three steps</h2>
 *
 * There is deliberately no `back/review` or `back/confirm`. The selection is not
 * linkable state — a link would carry one person's half-made pledge to somebody
 * who cannot pay for it — and a reservation lives for five minutes, so a back
 * button that could re-enter the review step would routinely land on a hold that
 * has expired. `CheckoutView` explains the same decision from the other side.
 *
 * `?reward=` is not a counter-example, and `rewardId` below says why: a tier
 * identifier is public catalogue data that reserves nothing, and it seeds step
 * one rather than skipping it.
 *
 * <h2>Not indexed, and not followed either</h2>
 *
 * A checkout is not a landing page. A search result pointing here is a dead end
 * for anybody arriving without a session, and the campaign's own page — which
 * this route is reached from — is the thing worth ranking.
 *
 * `follow` used to be true here, on the reasoning that the campaign links on the
 * page were worth crawling. There are none: everything below is rendered by
 * `CheckoutView` in the browser from data fetched with a token a crawler does not
 * have, so the markup a crawler receives has no links in it. `follow: true` was a
 * promise of crawl budget spent finding nothing, and every private surface in this
 * application now says the same two words — `privatePageMetadata` holds both.
 *
 * The rewards are loaded in the browser, so this is a shell and `CheckoutView` is
 * the client boundary — the same shape `/projects/[id]/edit/rewards` takes, and
 * for the same reason: nothing from `@ideanest/ui` may be imported by a Server
 * Component, because it is a barrel and several of its members reach for
 * `createContext`.

/**
 * `?reward=` — the tier the reader pressed on the campaign page, or null.
 *
 * <h2>Why a tier identifier may be in the URL when a pledge may not</h2>
 *
 * `useCheckout` states the rule this looks like an exception to: the selection is React
 * state and the route has no query string, because a half-made pledge is not shareable and
 * a back button must not re-enter a reservation that has expired.
 *
 * Neither argument reaches this parameter. It is not a pledge — it reserves nothing, prices
 * nothing and belongs to nobody; it is an identifier this campaign's public page already
 * printed, and the worst a shared link can do is open somebody else's checkout with a tier
 * highlighted that they are free to change. The `?token=` parameter beside it has been
 * carrying more sensitive data than this since PL-15.
 *
 * <p><strong>Repeated or empty is treated as absent.</strong> Next hands a repeated parameter
 * over as an array, and there is no sensible reading of two tiers: the reader pressed one
 * control. Guessing at the first would preselect a tier nobody chose on a screen whose next
 * step commits money.
