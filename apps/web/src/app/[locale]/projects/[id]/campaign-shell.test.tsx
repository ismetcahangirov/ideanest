/**
 * The two public routes under `/projects/{id}` carry the site shell — issue #343.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a test and not a screenshot review</h2>
 *
 * The campaign page shipped for months with no header and no footer, and nobody caught it,
 * because every screenshot of it was taken by somebody who already knew what the page was
 * and had arrived at it deliberately. What was missing is only missing to a stranger — the
 * reader who lands on a shared link and then wants to go somewhere else. `docs/ui-kit.md`
 * §8.6 makes the header and the footer part of the frame rather than part of any page, so
 * "is the frame there" is a structural question, and this is where it gets answered.
 *
 * The route matters more than most: `/projects/{creatorSlug}/{projectSlug}` is the address
 * every social post, every search result and every discovery card points at. It is the front
 * door for a reader who has never seen the platform before.
 *
 * <h2>The three assertions, and what each one is guarding</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>A `banner` and a `contentinfo`.</strong> The literal regression: a layout
 *       chain that reaches the page without passing through `SiteShell` renders neither.
 *   <li><strong>Exactly one `main`.</strong> Both pages used to declare their own, and
 *       putting a shell above them without taking those away would trade a missing landmark
 *       for an ambiguous one — "jump to main" with two answers. `MinimalShell.test.tsx`
 *       guards the same property on the other shell.
 *   <li><strong>The skip link resolves.</strong> It is the first focusable element in the
 *       document and it points at that one `main`, which is what makes it a skip link rather
 *       than an anchor to nowhere.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>What is deliberately NOT asserted here</h2>
 *
 * Nothing about `/projects/{id}/back`. The checkout must keep no site header —
 * `docs/ui-kit.md` §8.5 and `docs/motion-system.md` §5 — and a leaf layout per public
 * segment is what keeps it that way without a rule anybody has to remember. A test that
 * asserted the absence of chrome on the checkout would be asserting the shape of the
 * directory tree, which the tree already states.
