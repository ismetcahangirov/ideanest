 * The project is loaded with the account's bearer token from the browser, so
 * this page is a shell and `FaqPanel` is the client boundary — the same shape as
 * `/projects/[id]/edit/basics`, `/story` and `/rewards`.
 *
 * The write endpoints behind the panel are authorised by the `MANAGE_FAQ`
 * project capability rather than by `EDIT_BASICS` (docs/architecture.md §4.4).
 * Nothing here checks it: the service is the thing that decides, and a client
 * that hid the tab on its own reading of a capability list would be a second,
 * weaker copy of an authorisation rule. A collaborator without the grant sees
 * the tab and is refused with a sentence, which is the honest failure.
