/**
 * The campaign editor and the create form carry the site shell — issue #347.
 *
 * <h2>The landmark assertion is the one that earns this file</h2>
 *
 * `EditorShell` renders a `<header>` of its own — the campaign's title, its state and the
 * save indicator. HTML gives that element the `banner` role **unless it is descended from
 * `main`**, and until #347 it was, because every tab wrapped it in a `<main>` of its own.
 * Putting a shell above the editor and leaving those in place would have produced two
 * `main`s and two `banner`s at once, and neither is visible in a screenshot: a page with two
 * banners tells a screen-reader user there are two site headers to choose between.
 *
 * So the real editor is rendered here rather than a stand-in. A test that mounted a
 * paragraph would pass whether or not the header nesting was right, which is the only thing
 * this arrangement can get wrong.
 *
 * <h2>Motion is not asserted, and that is deliberate</h2>
 *
 * `docs/motion-system.md` §5 gives the editor "None — autosave indicator only" and gives the
 * shell "One — §4.7's collapse". The layout's docblock argues why those coexist; the
 * argument is about which row of a table the collapse is charged to, and a test cannot check
 * a budget's bookkeeping. Storybook and review own that.
