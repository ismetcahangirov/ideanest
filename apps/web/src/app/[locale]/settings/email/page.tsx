 * account's, behind a bearer token, and the only call on the page is a write. There is nothing
 * a server render could produce — and, for the same reason `SessionProvider` gives, nothing it
 * could read either: the refresh cookie is issued on `Path=/v1/auth`, so a request for this
 * page carries no session for `cookies()` to find.
 *
 * <h2>It is a page of its own rather than a section of `/settings/security`</h2>
 *
 * The security screen is two-factor authentication, which is something to set up once. This is
 * something to change when an address stops working, and the two are reached from different
 * moments. `/settings/password` is next door for the same reason and is linked from here,
 * because the two credentials are the pair somebody thinks about together — but they are not
 * one form: A-13 signs every session out and A-12 signs none out, and putting the two
 * submissions on one screen would put one warning over both.
