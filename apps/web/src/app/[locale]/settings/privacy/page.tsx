/**
 * `/settings/privacy` — §4.1 A-10 and A-11 and §4.2 P-07, issues #279 and #274.
 *
 * <h2>The visibility switch is first, and the other two keep their order</h2>
 *
 * §4.2's P-07 needed a home, and this is the page about who can see what: it already holds
 * the data export and the account closure. `ProfileVisibilityPanel` explains why it is not on
 * a profile editor — there is no `PATCH /v1/me` for a name or a biography, so a
 * `/settings/profile` built to hold one switch would be a screen whose other four fields do
 * not exist.
 *
 * It goes **above** the pair below rather than between them. Those two are read as one
 * argument, in the order given here, and a control about something else in the middle of it
 * would break the argument rather than join it. It is also the smallest of the three and the
 * only one that is reversible in a keystroke, which is the right thing to meet first on a page
 * whose last panel closes an account.
 *
 * <h2>The export is above the closure, and the order is the point</h2>
 *
 * They are the two halves of the same moment: §17.4 anonymises a closed account after thirty
 * days, and the export is the only way to keep anything after that. Putting the closure first
 * would be putting the irreversible action above the one that makes it survivable. Somebody
 * who scrolls to the bottom of this page has read the offer to take their data with them.
 *
 * **The order is not enforcement.** A closure does not require an export first, and it should
 * not: making somebody download a file before they may leave is a dark pattern wearing a
 * safety argument.
