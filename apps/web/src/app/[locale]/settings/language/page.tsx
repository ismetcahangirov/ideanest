/**
 * THE METADATA IS ENGLISH WHILE THE PAGE IS NOT, and that is a choice rather than an omission.
 *
 * Not for the reason this paragraph used to give. It said the document stayed `lang="en"`
 * because the public routes were cached shared renders; #123 shipped the locale-prefixed URLs
 * that removed that constraint, and `app/[locale]/layout.tsx` declares the route's own
 * language now.
 *
 * What is left is a smaller and still sufficient reason: this page is `noindex, nofollow`, so
 * the only reader of its title is the person who opened it, and the one string a
 * `generateMetadata` would change is already the `<h1>` below in their own language. A browser
 * tab is not worth a per-route metadata function; when the settings area grows one for its own
 * sake, this comes with it.

/**
 * `/settings/language` — §4.2's P-10, issue #280.
 *
 * <h2>A server component that reads the catalogue, wrapping a client component that writes</h2>
 *
 * The strings come from `getTranslations` here and go down as props. The alternative —
 * `useTranslations` inside the panel — needs a `NextIntlClientProvider` above it, and that
 * provider serialises a catalogue into the route's first load so the browser can look up nine
 * strings it could have been handed. `LanguagePanel` explains the same trade from its side.
 *
 * `getLocale()` is the language this render is actually in, negotiated from the cookie by
 * `src/i18n/request.ts`. It is passed down so the control opens on the language the reader is
 * looking at rather than on a guess, and so it is a **server** value: reading the cookie inside
 * the client component would answer `null` on the server and the real cookie on hydration,
 * which is a mismatch for everybody whose language is not the default.
 *
 * It is run through `localeOrDefault` on the way past. next-intl types its locale as a plain
 * string, and the four tags are the vocabulary `lib/i18n/locale.ts` owns — narrowing at the
 * boundary is what stops a value the catalogue happened to accept from reaching a `<select>`
 * whose options cannot express it.
 *
 * <h2>Dynamic, and already paid for</h2>
 *
 * Reading a cookie makes this render dynamic. `src/i18n/request.ts` argues at length that this
 * is free on `/settings/*`, which is behind authentication and rendered per person already, and
 * expensive on the cached public routes — which is why the catalogue covers this half of the
 * application and not that one.
 *
 * <h2>It is a page rather than a section of `/settings`</h2>
 *
 * §4.2 lists P-10 beside the notification preferences, and they are not one screen: the
 * notification grid is a matrix of channels a person tunes over time, and this is one choice
 * made once. Putting them together would also mean one Save over two unrelated writes — a
 * language that failed to save because a notification row did.
