/**
 * §4.11's AD-11, second screen: what the platform charges a creator to publish.
 *
 * <p>Filed under AD-11 beside the fee editor rather than as a seventeenth module. A fee comes
 * out of a backer's pledge and a plan comes out of a creator's pocket, which is the same
 * authority over the same subject — `lib/admin/navigation.ts` has the argument, and it is the
 * one `/admin/staff` was filed under AD-04 by.
 *
 * <p>Unlike the fee editor, a plan is edited in place. What a subscriber was charged is
 * snapshotted onto their own subscription at purchase, so nothing here reaches backwards into
 * a bill — the screen's own notice says so, because somebody arriving from the fee editor
 * arrives with the opposite expectation.
 *
 * <p>`privatePageMetadata` for the reason every console route gives: these pages are
 * per-person, they are not for a crawler, and several of them name people.
