/**
 * One account: its standing, its campaigns, and what it has backed — issue #404.
 *
 * <p><strong>The screen the console did not have.</strong> `/admin/users` offered one control
 * per row — suspend — and the row's own copy said that suspending "changes nothing about the
 * campaigns they created or the pledges they made". That is exactly the context a moderator
 * needs in order to decide, and there was no user detail screen anywhere in the console to
 * see it: no link, no history, nothing. The decision was taken on a name and an address.
 *
 * <p><strong>The heading does not name the person.</strong> Resolving it would mean reading
 * an audited, staff-only endpoint on the server, and the console has no server-side session
 * to read it with — the access token lives in the browser (`lib/api/client.ts`). So the page
 * is titled by what it is and the panel says who it is about, which is the arrangement
 * `/admin/campaigns/[projectId]` and `/admin/moderation/[reportId]` both use.
 *
 * <p>There is a second reason here that those two do not have: this title would be somebody's
 * name, and a browser tab, a history entry and a shared screenshot are three places it would
 * then appear outside the console.
 *
 * <p>`privatePageMetadata` for the reason every console route gives. <strong>THE ROUTE IS NOT
 * A GATE</strong> — the service refuses a caller who is not staff and this screen renders that
 * refusal; a check here would be a second, weaker copy of one the service already makes
 * correctly.
 *
 * <p>`[userId]` sits beside no static siblings under `/admin/users`, so nothing shadows it —
 * worth stating because `/admin/curation/[slug]` does have three and had to say so.
