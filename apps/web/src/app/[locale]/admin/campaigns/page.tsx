/**
 * §4.11's campaign directory — what campaigns exist.
 *
 * The console could operate a campaign and could not find one: every route to a campaign
 * started from something the campaign had done — a report filed about it, a submission
 * waiting on a decision, or an identifier a member of staff already had. A draft, or a
 * live campaign, or one cleared for launch a week ago and not launched, appeared on no
 * screen here.
 *
 * `privatePageMetadata` for the reason every console route gives — an administration
 * surface has no business in an index. THE ROUTE IS NOT A GATE: the service refuses a
 * caller without `MODERATE_CONTENT` and this screen renders that refusal, and a check
 * here would be a second, weaker copy of one the service already makes correctly.
 *
 * No `<main>` of its own: `AdminArea` owns the only one on the page, and the width comes
 * from the shell so the console's screens line up with each other.
