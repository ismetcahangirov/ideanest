/**
 * One campaign, as its page reads, for the moderator deciding it — issue #399.
 *
 * <p><strong>The route the submission queue was missing.</strong> That queue asks for an
 * irreversible decision about a campaign and linked to the public page, which for a campaign
 * in review is a 404 by construction — so approval happened on a title, a creator's name and
 * a goal figure. This renders the same page a backer would see, in whatever state the
 * campaign is in.
 *
 * <p><strong>The heading does not name the campaign.</strong> Resolving its title would mean
 * reading the admin endpoint on the server, and the console has no server-side session to
 * read it with — the access token lives in the browser (`lib/api/client.ts`). So the page is
 * titled by what it is and the panel says which campaign it is, which is the arrangement
 * every other console detail route uses.
 *
 * <p>`privatePageMetadata` for the reason every console route gives, and one of its own that
 * is stronger than most: this screen renders drafts, which are private working documents
 * their creators have shown nobody. THE ROUTE IS NOT A GATE — the service refuses a caller
 * without `MODERATE_CONTENT` and this screen renders that refusal, and a check here would be
 * a second, weaker copy of one the service already makes correctly.
 *
 * <p>The route is `[projectId]` beside no static siblings under `/admin/campaigns`, so
 * nothing shadows it; that is worth stating because `/admin/curation/[slug]` does have three
 * and had to say so.
