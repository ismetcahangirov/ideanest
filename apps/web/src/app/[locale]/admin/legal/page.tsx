/**
 * §22.2's eight documents, drafted and published — issue #425.
 *
 * <p>Filed under §4.11's AD-11, which is the module about what the platform charges and
 * what it obliges: a fee, a plan and the creator agreement are three subjects of one
 * authority, and all three need `CONFIGURE_PLATFORM`. `lib/admin/navigation.ts` carries the
 * argument for why that is truthful rather than a seventeenth module, and why the rail
 * nevertheless files this under Platform.
 *
 * <p><strong>There is no edit and no delete.</strong> A published version is immutable —
 * V65 puts a trigger on the table — because an acceptance names a version, and an
 * acceptance of a text that can be edited afterwards is evidence of nothing. The screen is
 * built to make that obvious rather than to warn about it; `LegalDocumentEditor` explains
 * how.
 *
 * <p><strong>No text ships with this.</strong> The eight kinds exist and none of them has
 * words yet: they are #423's adviser's, and #439 publishes them. A page that seeded its own
 * terms of use would be this repository writing a legal position.
 *
 * <p>`privatePageMetadata` for the reason every console route gives: these pages are
 * per-person, they are not for a crawler, and several of them name people.
