/**
 * AD-01's campaign review queue — what the three moderation outcomes apply to.
 *
 * The console had a queue of complaints and no queue of submissions, so the only route
 * to a campaign awaiting review was a report somebody had filed about it. A campaign
 * nobody complained about therefore waited in `SUBMITTED` indefinitely, invisible to
 * every screen here, while its creator was told it was under review.
 *
 * `privatePageMetadata` for the reason the queue beside it gives — an administration
 * surface has no business in an index. THE ROUTE IS NOT A GATE: the service refuses a
 * caller without `MODERATE_CONTENT` and this screen renders that refusal, and a check
 * here would be a second, weaker copy of one the service already makes correctly.
 *
 * No `<main>` of its own: `AdminArea` owns the only one on the page, and the width comes
 * from the shell so the console's screens line up with each other.
