/**
 * The inbox carries the site shell — issue #345.
 *
 * **This route is reached FROM the header.** `SiteHeader` draws a bell that links here, and
 * so do `AccountMenu` and `MobileNavDrawer`. A frame that disappears on arrival is therefore
 * not only a missing landmark, it is a control that appears to leave the site — and none of
 * that is visible in a screenshot of the inbox, because whoever takes one already knows where
 * they are. It is a structural question, so it is answered here.
 *
 * The three properties, and what each guards:
 *
 *   1. a `banner` and a `contentinfo` — the regression itself.
 *   2. exactly one `main` — the page declared its own before this layout existed, and a shell
 *      added above it without taking that away would trade a missing landmark for an
 *      ambiguous one. `MinimalShell.test.tsx` guards the same property on the other shell.
 *   3. the skip link points at that `main` — otherwise it is an anchor to nowhere.
