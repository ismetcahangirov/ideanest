/**
 * `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` — issue #114.
 *
 * <h2>A route handler, because the content type matters and has no extension</h2>
 *
 * The address is fixed by Apple and carries no file extension, so a copy in
 * `public/` would be served as `application/octet-stream`. iOS requires
 * `application/json`, and it does not tell you when it did not get it — the file
 * is fetched by Apple's CDN, rejected, and universal links simply never activate.
 *
 * <h2>It is also why `src/proxy.ts` excludes `.well-known`</h2>
 *
 * Having no extension is exactly what the matcher's `.*\.[\w]+$` clause relies
 * on to leave a file alone, so this address was the one that would have been
 * redirected to `/en/.well-known/...`. Apple's fetcher does not follow the
 * redirect. That is #362's failure again, in the one file whose failure is
 * invisible from the site itself.
