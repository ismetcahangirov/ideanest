 * `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` — issue #114, Android's half.
 *
 * Android fetches this at install time when an intent filter carries
 * `autoVerify` (`apps/mobile/app.config.ts`), and it retries on its own
 * afterwards — so unlike Apple's file, an absence here is recoverable without a
 * reinstall. It is still served by a handler rather than from `public/`, because
 * the fingerprints it names differ per signing key and are read from the
 * environment for the reasons in `lib/mobile/association.ts`.
