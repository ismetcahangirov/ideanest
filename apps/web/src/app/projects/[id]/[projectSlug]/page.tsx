/**
 * The public campaign page — §4.4, at §10.2's `/projects/{creatorSlug}/{projectSlug}`.
 *
 * <h2>#119, and what "server-rendered" has to mean here</h2>
 *
 * The requirement is that the content is in the initial HTML rather than assembled by the
 * client. This page fetches the campaign, its reward tiers and whichever tab was asked for on
 * the server and renders them; there is no loading state, because there is nothing to load. A
 * crawler, a link unfurler and a reader on a slow connection are all served the same complete
 * document — including the comments, if that is the address they were given.
 *
 * That is also why the endpoint behind it carries the story: a page whose body arrived in a
 * second request would satisfy the letter of "server-rendered" and fail the thing it is for.
 *
 * <h2>The client boundaries beneath this route, and why each one is here</h2>
 *
 * The rule this page holds itself to is not "no client components" — it is that <em>no
 * content</em> waits for the browser. Every island below renders the server's answer first
 * and then adds something the server could not know:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>`LiveFunding`</strong> (#91) — starts from the rendered figures and adds
 *       §12.1's deltas.
 *   <li><strong>`CampaignCountdown` and `ViewerInstant`</strong> (#281) — the current time and
 *       the reader's time zone. Neither reaches a server render, and a cookie carrying the
 *       zone would make this page uncacheable, which is the arrangement §4.4 exists to
 *       protect.
 *   <li><strong>`CampaignActions`</strong> (#281) — save, share and the launch reminder. Two
 *       writes and a clipboard.
 *   <li><strong>`CommentComposer` and `CommentControls`</strong> (#285) — the three comment
 *       writes, all of which need a bearer token.
 *   <li><strong>`ReportControl`</strong> (#286) — §4.9's C-06 and C-07.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <strong>Not one of them imports `@ideanest/ui/motion`.</strong> That entry point is 116 kB
 * of animation runtime and the note below on entry animations is the whole argument; the
 * dialog entries on this page are CSS keyframes in `app/globals.css` for the same reason.
 *
 * <h2>The tabs are addresses, not state</h2>
 *
 * `?tab=comments` rather than a `useState` or a route per tab, and
 * `lib/projects/tabs.ts` argues all three options and the two it rejected. The short version:
 * local state makes the Comments tab unlinkable and invisible to a crawler, a route per tab
 * multiplies one canonical URL into six and adds five entries to a budgets file CI fails on
 * in both directions, and a query parameter costs a navigation that each tab's own separate
 * read was always going to need.
 *
 * <strong>Only the active tab is fetched, with exactly one exception.</strong> The updates,
 * the comments and the creator's profile are read only when their tab is the one being
 * rendered. Fetching all of them to render one would be several times the service load per
 * crawl for content nobody asked for, on the route whose largest contentful paint is the
 * subject of #119.
 *
 * <strong>The FAQ is the exception, and it is read on every tab.</strong> Not for the tab —
 * for the structured data. `faqPageNode` is documented as taking "the pairs the page actually
 * renders", and `projectPageGraph`'s whole argument is that the machine-readable and the
 * human-readable halves of this page cannot describe two different campaigns. The graph is
 * emitted before the tab is chosen and the canonical URL of every tab is the bare path, so an
 * `FAQPage` node built only on `?tab=faq` would hang off the one address no search engine
 * indexes separately — which is a node that exists for nobody.
 *
 * So this one read is paid on every render: one small, unpaged, minute-cached body against a
 * graph that is true on every address the campaign has. <strong>Do not "fix" this by moving
 * it inside the tab</strong> — it would silently empty the `FAQPage` node on four tabs out of
 * five. The tab is handed the same list rather than reading it again.
 *
 * <h2>Why the folder is `[id]/[projectSlug]` when the first segment is a creator's slug</h2>
 *
 * Next allows exactly one slug name per dynamic level, and `app/projects/[id]/` already
 * exists — it carries `/edit`, `/back` and `/prelaunch`, where the segment really is a
 * campaign identifier. A sibling `[creatorSlug]` is a build error, so the public page reuses
 * the name and binds it to `creatorSlug` below. **The URL is correct and the folder name is
 * a framework artefact**; renaming it belongs with whatever moves the creator's own routes
 * out from under `/projects`.
 *
 * There is no ambiguity at request time. `/{id}/edit` and its siblings are literal-segment
 * patterns, which Spring's counterpart and Next's router both prefer over two variables, so
 * `/projects/{uuid}/edit` never reaches this page.
 *
 * <h2>404, and the three things it covers</h2>
 *
 * A URL that resolves to nothing, a campaign whose state has no public page, and a service
 * that refused the read are one answer. `PublicProjects` argues it on the server side and
 * `readCampaignPage` re-checks the state here — the second lock on the same door.
 * `notFound()` renders the 404 route with a 404 status, which is what a crawler needs in
 * order to stop asking.
 *
 * <strong>A tab is never a 404.</strong> `?tab=nonsense` renders the campaign, because a
 * mistyped query parameter must not be able to take a real campaign off the internet;
 * `campaignTabFrom` states that rule and the canonical URL stays the bare path regardless, so
 * no search engine is told the mistyped address is a page of its own.

 * the component below read one response. That is the arrangement that makes it safe for the
 * `<head>` and the `<body>` to describe the campaign from the same projection rather than
 * from two reads a second apart.
 *
 * **The tab is deliberately not read here.** Every tab describes one campaign, so the title,
 * the description and above all the canonical are the campaign's rather than the tab's — a
 * canonical that varied by `?tab=` would tell a search engine this page is four pages whose
 * content is mostly identical, which is the duplicate-content problem the query parameter was
 * chosen to avoid in the first place.
 *

 * about it — `projectPageMetadata` explains why the failure mode has to be a card that says

        NO ENTRY ANIMATION, AND THAT IS A DECISION RATHER THAN AN OVERSIGHT.

        docs/motion-system.md §5 gives the project page a "moderate" budget — section
        headings, counters, a sticky call to action — so a `FadeUp` on this header would be
        within it. It is not here because of what it costs on this particular page.

        `FadeUp` reaches `motion/react`, which `@ideanest/ui/motion` measures at 116 kB
        uncompressed and which is why that entry point exists at all. Reaching it from a
        Server Component also requires a client wrapper, so the whole header would become a
        client boundary. Paying both on the page whose largest contentful paint is the
        entire subject of #119 — to fade one heading in once — is the trade that issue
        exists to refuse.

        THE TABS DID NOT CHANGE THIS. #282, #284 and #285 added four client islands to this
        route, and none of them is an animation runtime: the largest is a textarea and a
        submit button. The budget was not spent, it was declined again — an entry animation on
        a comment list is an animation on the one surface where somebody is waiting for an
        answer to a question they asked.

        It becomes worth revisiting when the page has something else on it that animates,
        which §5's own list says it will: a counter on the funding figure and the sticky
        call to action that arrives with the pledge flow. At that point the runtime is being
        paid for anyway.
