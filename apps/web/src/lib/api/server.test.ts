/**
 * The reads a Server Component makes — #119.
 *
 * What is worth asserting here is the wiring, because none of it fails loudly:
 *
 *   - **an absolute URL.** `lib/api/client.ts` uses a relative `/v1` path, which works in a
 *     browser because `next.config.mjs` rewrites it and throws on a server, where there is
 *     no origin and no rewrite. Getting this wrong is a page that works in every test and
 *     500s in production;
 *   - **a refusal is `null`, a bug is not.** A 404 must render a 404 and a misconfigured
 *     base URL must not be swallowed into "this campaign does not exist";
 *   - **the filters reach the service under its own parameter names**, repeated where they
 *     were repeated — a comma-joined list is one filter whose name contains a comma.
