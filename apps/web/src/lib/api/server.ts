/**
 * Reads the service makes on the server, for the pages #119 renders there.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not `lib/api/client.ts`</h2>
 *
 * That module talks to `/v1` as a RELATIVE path, and that is deliberate: in a browser the
 * request is same-origin because `next.config.mjs` rewrites `/v1` to the service, which is
 * the only arrangement in which a `SameSite=Strict` refresh cookie travels at all.
 *
 * A relative path has no meaning inside a Server Component. There is no document, no
 * origin, and no rewrite — the rewrite is a property of the HTTP server this code runs
 * *in*, not of `fetch` — so the call that works in the browser throws `Failed to parse
 * URL` on the server. Server reads therefore go straight to `IDEANEST_API_ORIGIN`, which
 * `apiOrigin` reads from the same variable the rewrite does.
 *
 * <h2>Anonymous, and that is a decision rather than a limitation</h2>
 *
 * Nothing here sends a token. The pages that use it are public — a campaign page and the
 * discovery feed — and a server render that varied by session would be a page that cannot
 * be cached by anything, shared by anybody, or served to the crawler #119 exists for. A
 * signed-in visitor's personal additions to those pages (whether they have saved a
 * campaign, whether they have backed it) belong to a client component that fetches them
 * after hydration, because those are the parts that must not be in a shared cache.
 *
 * <h2>Failure is `null`, never a thrown page</h2>
 *
 * Every reader below answers `null` when the service refuses or cannot be reached. A
 * Server Component that throws takes the whole route to an error page, and the difference
 * between "this campaign does not exist" and "the API is restarting" is the difference
 * between a 404 and a 500 — decided at the call site, where the page knows which it wants.

 * <h2>THE LANGUAGE IS DEFAULTED HERE NOW, AND #123 IS WHAT MADE IT FREE</h2>
 *
 * This function used to send no `Accept-Language` at all, and the paragraph here explained
 * why at length: negotiating one meant reading the locale cookie, reading a cookie makes a
 * render dynamic, and these are the cached public reads a stranger meets first. The
 * consequence was written down rather than hidden — the taxonomy names inside a cached
 * public page followed whatever language the *server's* request happened to carry, on an
 * otherwise English page, which is the asymmetry #324 was filed about.
 *
 * That argument is spent. The language is a path segment, so `/az/discover` and
 * `/ru/discover` are two cached documents rather than one document with a `Vary` on it, and
 * `getLocale()` reads the value `layout.tsx` already handed to `setRequestLocale`. No
 * cookie, no header, no variance per visitor — one fixed language per cache entry, which is
 * exactly what a shared cache wants.
 *
 * <h2>The fallback is not decoration</h2>
 *
 * `getLocale()` throws outside a request scope, and this module is read from two of them:
 * `app/sitemap.ts` and the unit tests. Neither is rendering a page for anybody, so neither
 * has a language to speak — `DEFAULT_LOCALE` is the honest answer, and the same one the
 * service's own RFC 4647 lookup would have arrived at from an absent header.
 *
 * An explicit `options.locale` still wins, because a caller inside an already-dynamic route
