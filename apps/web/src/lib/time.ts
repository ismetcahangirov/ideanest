/**
 * Rendering an instant for a reader.
 *
 * Lifted out of `lib/sessions/describe.ts` when the notification inbox (#88) needed the
 * same two functions. Nothing about "3 hours ago" is about a session, and the alternative
 * — a second module importing `lib/sessions` for a formatter — would have made the inbox
 * depend on the device list for no reason anybody could find later.
 *
 * `lib/sessions/describe.ts` re-exports both, so its own callers and tests are unchanged.
 *
 * <h2>THE LOCALE IS A PARAMETER NOW, AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL — #324</h2>
 *
 * Both functions were pinned to English with the limitation written down: "these strings are
 * the only record on screen of when something happened, and a reader in Azerbaijani currently
 * gets them in English." The pin was waiting on #123's locale-prefixed routing, which has
 * landed, so it is gone.
 *
 * <p>It is a required parameter rather than one defaulting to `DEFAULT_LOCALE` on purpose. A
 * default would have compiled every existing call site unchanged and left seventy of them
 * quietly English — the same defect, now invisible instead of documented. Making it required
 * is what turned "find every screen that prints a time" from an audit into a typecheck.
 *
 * <p>Server components read the locale from `getLocale()`; client components read it from
 * `useRouteLocale()`, which takes it off the matched route segment. Neither reads a cookie,
 * so neither makes a render dynamic.
