/**
 * The cache tag vocabulary — issue #127.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER:
 *
 *   - **everything this module composes, it also recognises.** The two halves are read by
 *     different sides — the reads compose, the endpoint recognises — and a builder that
 *     produced a tag the guard rejected would be a page that silently never refreshes.
 *   - **the two shapes that would evict the whole cache are refused.** An empty identifier
 *     and a wildcard are what a caller with a bug produces, and the guard is the only thing
 *     between them and every cached render on the platform.
 *   - **a campaign address is two slugs and exactly two.** Neither is unique alone.
