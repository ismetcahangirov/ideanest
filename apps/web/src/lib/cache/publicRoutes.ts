/**
 * Which pages a shared cache may hold, and for how long — issue #127.
 *
 * <h2>Why a shared cache is safe here at all</h2>
 *
 * Because every server render in this application is anonymous, and that is a property rather
 * than a coincidence. The refresh cookie is issued on `Path=/v1/auth`, so a request for a page
 * carries no session for `cookies()` to read; `SessionProvider` says so, and nothing under
 * `src/` calls `next/headers` at all. A signed-in reader and a stranger are served the same
 * HTML and the difference appears after hydration.
 *
 * <p>That is what makes `public` truthful on the responses below. It is also why this list is
 * an allow-list of path shapes rather than a deny-list of the private ones: the day a page
 * does start varying by reader, the mistake to be protected against is one nobody remembered
 * to add to a deny-list.
 *
 * <h2>Sixty seconds, matching everything else</h2>
 *
 * The service puts sixty seconds on its own `Cache-Control` for these reads, `lib/api/server.ts`
 * holds the same window, and a third number here would be a third cache with an opinion. What
 * this adds on top is `stale-while-revalidate`: a shared cache may serve the minute-old copy
 * while it fetches a fresh one, so the reader who arrives at second sixty-one waits for a
 * network hop rather than for a render.
 *
 * <h2>WHY THIS IS NOT `next.config.mjs`'s `headers()`</h2>
 *
 * Because the campaign page's address is `/{locale}/projects/{id}/{projectSlug}` and the
 * creator's editor is `/{locale}/projects/{id}/edit`. A path pattern that matches the first
 * matches the second, and the shape of that mistake — a creator's unpublished draft page
 * marked publicly cacheable — is exactly the kind that is invisible in review and obvious in
 * production. Here the private segments are named, checked, and covered by a test that reads
 * the list rather than repeating it.
