/**
 * Which pages a shared cache may hold — issue #127.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER, and the second one is the whole reason this is a function:
 *
 *   - **the public pages are marked public**, in every language, because the cache key is the
 *     path and each language is a different document.
 *   - **NOTHING THAT BELONGS TO ONE PERSON IS.** The campaign's public page is
 *     `/projects/{id}/{slug}` and the creator's editor is `/projects/{id}/edit`; a path pattern
 *     in `next.config.mjs` that matched the first would match the second, and the shape of that
 *     mistake is a creator's unpublished draft marked publicly cacheable. Every private
 *     section is named below and asserted against.
 *   - **an unrecognised path gets nothing**, so the framework's own `private, no-store` stands.
 *     A default that leaked would be a default nobody thought about.
