 * terminal outcomes a moderator can record about it. `ProjectModerationController`
 * owns the campaign's state machine, and its three outcomes are what
 * docs/architecture.md §4.11 calls AD-01. Deciding a report deliberately does not
 * act on what was reported (AD-02's own note says so), so a moderator who agrees
 * with a complaint and a moderator who takes a campaign down are performing two
 * requests, and this module keeps them two functions.
 *
 * `GET /v1/admin/moderation/queue` — the campaign review queue §10.2 lists — is
 * NOT implemented in the service. The three campaign outcomes exist and are
 * reachable by project id, but nothing lists the campaigns awaiting review, so
 * they are offered here from a report about a campaign and from nowhere else.
