/**
 * §4.8's PM-07 to PM-10, from the backer's side — where a reward is, and where it is going.
 *
 * <h2>Two things a backer can be told about a parcel</h2>
 *
 * `GET /v1/me/fulfilments` is the tracking: one row per pledge, carrying a status, a carrier
 * and a tracking number when the creator has recorded one. `GET|PATCH
 * /v1/pledges/{id}/shipping-address` is the address that parcel is going to. They are the
 * same screen's two halves, which is why they are one module.
 *
 * <h2>The address is replaced whole, and the PATCH is not a merge</h2>
 *
 * `ShippingAddressController` is explicit and the shape matters: the body replaces the
 * address entirely, so an omitted `line2` **clears** it. Merging a partial address is how
 * somebody who moved house ends up with the old flat number on the new street. The form
 * therefore sends every field on every save, including the empty ones.
 *
 * <h2>A locked address is not an error to recover from</h2>
 *
 * PM-08 lets a creator freeze every address before printing labels. A locked row still reads
 * — somebody has to be able to see where their parcel is going — and refuses the write. The
 * screen renders it read-only rather than offering a form that will 409.
