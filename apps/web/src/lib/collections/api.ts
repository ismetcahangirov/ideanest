/**
 * §4.3's D-08 — curated collections and open calls, as `GET /v1/collections` and
 * `GET /v1/collections/{slug}` send them (`CollectionController`, `CollectionResponses`).
 *
 * ONE MODULE, ONE PLACE, the rule `lib/categories/api.ts` and `lib/discovery/api.ts` already
 * state. The shapes come from the controller; nothing here invents a field.
 *
 * <h2>A collection that is not visible is ABSENT, and the client must not decorate that</h2>
 *
 * The service answers **404** for a slug that names nothing, for a collection that has not
 * been published, and for one outside its own window. Three different facts, one answer,
 * deliberately — `CollectionController` gives the argument in full: which campaigns the
 * platform is about to put its name behind, and by implication which it passed over, is a
 * commercially interesting fact about its plans, and a 403 would confirm that
 * `/collections/spring-2027` exists to anybody who guesses the slug.
 *
 * So nothing in this module distinguishes them, nothing renders "this collection is not open
 * yet", and the page renders the ordinary not-found route for all three. `lib/profiles/api.ts`
 * holds the same line for a private profile and explains why a client that tried to be
 * helpful here would be an oracle built on top of an endpoint designed not to be one.
 *
 * <h2>The cards are the discovery feed's cards, and deliberately the same type</h2>
 *
 * `CollectionResponses.page` maps every member through `DiscoveryResponses::card`, so a
 * collection's items are byte for byte the shape `/v1/discover` answers with. Importing
 * `ProjectCard` rather than restating it is what lets `CampaignGrid` render a collection with
 * the card the feed already argues about — the badge, the lime urgency pill, the progress
 * figure read with `decimal.js` — instead of a second card for the same JSON.
 *
 * <h2>Null fields are absent, not null</h2>
 *
 * The service serialises with `default-property-inclusion: non_null`, so a collection with no
 * standfirst has no `description` key at all and the last page has no `nextCursor` key. The
 * wire types below say so; the types a component sees say `T | null`, because a page renders
 * "there is no cover" and never "the field I expected is missing".

 *
 * WIDENED ON PURPOSE, the same decision `ProjectCard.state` takes. §4.3 may grow a fourth
 * kind, and a service that starts sending it must not be able to make this application throw
 * or render nothing: a page that meets an unfamiliar kind prints the collection without a
 * kind label, which is a page. `kindLabel` is the one place that narrows, and it answers
 * `null` rather than guessing.
 *
 * <h2>The window is two instants, and a visible collection is always inside it</h2>
 *
 * `PostgresCuratedCollections` selects on `opens_at IS NULL OR opens_at <= now()` and
 * `closes_at IS NULL OR closes_at > now()`, so anything a reader can reach opened in the past
 * and closes in the future. That is what makes "Closes 12 September" honest without this
 * module having to compare against a clock — and it is also why `windowFacts` states the
 * dates rather than a countdown: a response may be sixty seconds old (the endpoint is cached
 * for that long), and a date does not go stale in sixty seconds while "closes in 1 minute"

 * without a translation still has an address and a page worth reaching. A collection is
 * different in both halves. Without a slug it has **no URL at all**, so a card for it would be
 * a link to `/collections/` — an entry in an index that navigates nowhere, and one a crawler
 * would follow. Without a title there is nothing to call it; the slug is a curator's internal
 * handle rather than a name in the reader's language, and printing `spring-2027-open-call` as
 * a heading is worse than not listing the collection at all.
 *
 * Neither can happen against the service as it stands — `CollectionResponses.Collection` fills
 * both from non-null columns. This is the gate that keeps a future contract change from
 * putting a dead link in the site's own crawl path.
 *
 * The cover is dropped whole when any of its three fields is missing. `MediaFrame` reserves a
