/**
 * What a collection landing page resolves to — D-08, issue #266.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER:
 *
 *   - **every refusal is the same answer.** A slug that names nothing, a collection that has
 *     not been published, one outside its window, and a service that could not be reached all
 *     resolve to `not-found`. The first three are indistinguishable by design
 *     (`CollectionController`: a 403 would confirm that `/collections/spring-2027` exists to
 *     anybody who guesses), and this function must not undo that by telling them apart.
 *   - the campaigns arrive in the curator's order and are passed through untouched.
 *   - `nextCursor` is carried, because a short page is not the end of a collection — only the
 *     absence of a cursor is.
 *   - the social description is the curator's own standfirst when there is one, and invents no
 *     count and no deadline when there is not.
