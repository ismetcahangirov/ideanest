/**
 * The legal pages' server reads — §22.2, issue #439.
 *
 * <h2>These routes stay static, and every choice here is in service of that</h2>
 *
 * #439 is explicit: "Static, and they must stay static: these are the pages a stranger and a
 * regulator read, they change a few times a year, and rendering them per request would be a
 * dynamic route for no reason. No client provider, no cookie read."
 *
 * So: `credentials: 'omit'`, no `Authorization` header, no `cookies()`, no `headers()`, and the
 * locale comes from `params` rather than from a request. Nothing about a read varies by reader,
 * which is what the requirement is actually about — a page that read a session would be one no
 * shared cache could hold. (Every route in this application builds as `ƒ` because of the locale
 * proxy; `legal/[document]/page.tsx` records why that is not the same question.)
 *
 * <h2>An hour, matching the service's own cache directive</h2>
 *
 * `LegalDocumentController` sends `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600` for what is in force and
 * thirty days for an archived version. This window matches the first; the archive gets the same
 * one rather than thirty days, because a page revalidating hourly against an immutable document
 * costs one request an hour and a page pinned for a month is one a redeploy cannot correct.
 *
 * The {@link LEGAL} tag is what makes the window survivable in the direction that matters: a
 * version published this morning is what somebody accepting this afternoon is shown, because
 * publishing invalidates the tag rather than waiting out the hour.
 *
 * <h2>A 404 is "not published", and the page renders that rather than failing</h2>
 *
 * The service answers 404 for a document with no published version, which is the state this
 * repository is in until #423's adviser delivers the words. That is not an error to apologise
 * for: §22.2 says the platform must *have* eight documents, and a page that said "something
 * went wrong" would be hiding the fact that one has not been written. `notFound()` is wrong
 * for the same reason — the address is real and permanent, and a 404 tells a crawler to stop
 * asking.
 *
 * <h2>Anything else is "unavailable", and it is not the same answer — issue #147</h2>
 *
 * This module used to return `null` for every non-OK status and every thrown error, so a 503,
 * a timeout or a DNS failure was drawn as "this document has not been published yet". On
 * 2026-09-28, during the DNS move, `/legal/terms-of-use` told readers IdeaNest had no terms.
 * {@link LegalRead} now keeps the two apart: 404 alone is `unpublished`, and everything that is
 * not a document — any other status, a rejected `fetch`, a body that does not narrow — is
 * `unavailable`, which the pages draw with `FailureState`.
 *
 * <strong>An unavailable answer is not held for the hour.</strong> Next's data cache stores a
 * `fetch` response only when its status is 200 (`patch-fetch`), and a rejected `fetch` stores
 * nothing, so the window below covers published documents and nothing else. These routes build
 * as `ƒ`, so there is no rendered copy of the failure either: the next request asks again. If a
 * route here is ever made static, that property has to be re-established for it, because an
 * incremental render would otherwise pin the failure state for the route's window.
