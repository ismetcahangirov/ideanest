/**
 * §22.2's eight documents, as the client reads them — issues #425 and #439.
 *
 * <h2>The kinds are closed here as well as in the service</h2>
 *
 * `DocumentKind` and V65's `legal_documents_kind_known` already say the same eight names, and
 * this is the third statement of the same closed set. It is not redundancy for its own sake:
 * this list is what turns a URL segment into a document, and a ninth appearing would otherwise
 * be a 404 that looked like a routing bug rather than a change to §22.2.
 *
 * <h2>The address is a slug, and the slug is not the enum</h2>
 *
 * `/legal/terms-of-use`, not `/legal/TERMS_OF_USE`. A URL is read aloud, pasted into a
 * regulator's email and printed at the bottom of an invoice, and a database value in one is the
 * platform showing its plumbing — the same argument `DocumentKind` itself makes about why the
 * kind is not the title.
 *
 * The mapping is stated once, here, in both directions. Two independent transformations would
 * be a page that generates a link it cannot resolve.
