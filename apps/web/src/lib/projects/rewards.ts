/**
 * The rewards tab, as data: what the creator has typed, what is wrong with it,
 * and what that turns into on the wire.
 *
 * Kept out of the components for the reason `basics.ts` gives — these are the
 * rules of docs/architecture.md §5.3 and of `RewardService`, and rules that live
 * inside a form are rules nobody can test at their boundaries. Eighty
 * characters, a hundred tiers, a price of zero, and a limit one below what is
 * claimed are exactly where this fails, so they are exactly what the tests
 * drive.
 *
 * <h3>THE CLIENT VALIDATES WHAT IS WRONG, NOT WHAT IS MISSING</h3>
 *
 * The same rule the basics tab follows. §5.3 is a list of SUBMISSION
 * requirements and a draft is by definition incomplete, so "too long", "not a
 * number", "below what is already taken" and "two settings that contradict each
 * other" are errors here; "not filled in yet" is not. The two exceptions are a
 * tier's title and its price, because neither is optional at the endpoint: a
 * tier with no price is not something a backer can select, and the service
 * refuses both outright.
 *
 * <h3>THE SERVER IS STILL THE AUTHORITY</h3>
 *
 * Everything below is duplicated in `RewardService`, deliberately. This copy
 * exists so a creator gets a specific message beside the input instead of a
 * round trip; it is not the enforcement. Where the two disagree the server
 * wins, which is why every form here renders the refusal it gets back as well
 * as the check it ran first.
