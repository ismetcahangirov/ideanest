/**
 * The basics tab, as data: what the creator has typed, what is wrong with it,

 *
 * Kept out of the component because these are the rules of docs/architecture
 * §5.3, and rules that live inside a form are rules nobody can unit-test at the
 * boundaries. Sixty characters, one hundred and thirty-five characters, one day
 * and sixty days are exactly the places this fails, so they are exactly the
 * places worth testing.
 *
 * THE CLIENT VALIDATES WHAT IS WRONG, NOT WHAT IS MISSING. §5.3 is a list of
 * SUBMISSION requirements, and a draft is by definition incomplete — a form
 * that reports "summary is required" the moment a project is created is a form
 * that shouts at somebody for not having finished yet. Completeness is the
 * checklist's job (#37), which reports it as progress rather than as failure and
 * is re-checked server-side by `POST /submit`. So: too long, out of range,
 * unreadable, or too small is an error here; not yet filled in is not.
 *
 * The one exception is the title. A project with no title cannot be listed
 * anywhere, `title` is `varchar(60) NOT NULL` behind the endpoint, and the
 * creator supplied one at creation — so clearing it is a mistake being made now
 * rather than work not yet done.
