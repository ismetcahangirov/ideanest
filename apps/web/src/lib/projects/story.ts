 * rules of the epic contract §5 and `docs/architecture.md` §5.3, and rules that
 * live inside a form are rules nobody can test at the boundaries. Anchors,
 * character counts, block moves, and the inline mark syntax all have exact edges,
 * so they are exactly what is worth testing.
 *
 * THE SHAPE IS THE CONTRACT, VERBATIM. #37's checklist counts characters in this
 * document and the public project page renders it, so a field invented here is a
 * field two other issues will not know about. The server validates the same schema
 * (`StoryDocuments`), and where the two could disagree — what a heading anchor
 * folds to, how a character is counted — this file matches the server rather than
 * doing what is convenient in JavaScript.
