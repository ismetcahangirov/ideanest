/**
 * The narrowing between the published contract and the page — #119.
 *
 * Every property on `ProjectPageResponse` is optional, because springdoc marks a field
 * required only when it can prove it. So this module is the one place that decides which
 * absences are survivable and which mean the response is not a campaign, and these are the
 * decisions:
 *
 *   - a missing identity, title or creator is `null` overall, never a half-built page;
 *   - a state that has no campaign page is `null`, which is the second lock on that door;
 *   - a missing goal, story, cover or outcome is a campaign without one, not a failure.
 *
 * The derived values get their own tests because both are arithmetic somebody will be shown:
 * the completion percentage is what "funded" means, and the countdown is what "last day"
 * means.
