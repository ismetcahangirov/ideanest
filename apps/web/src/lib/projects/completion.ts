/**
 * `pledged / goal × 100`, to two places, rounded down.
 *
 * Rounded DOWN, deliberately and to match the service's own `completionPercent`: a campaign at
 * 99.996% must not be reported as 100%, because 100% is the word "funded" on this platform and
 * it would be a claim about somebody's money.
 *
 * A goal of zero is `null` rather than infinity. §5.3 does not permit one, and a page that
 * divided by it would render `Infinity%`.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a module of its own</h2>
 *
 * It lived in `publicPage.ts` until #91, which needed it in a client component: the live counter
 * adds a delta to the pledged total and has to recompute the percentage beside it, or the two
 * numbers disagree on the same page.
 *
 * Importing it from `publicPage.ts` worked and cost 86 KiB. **A client component pulls its
 * whole import graph into the browser bundle**, and that module reasonably imports the campaign
 * page's response types, its reward projections and the readers for all of them — none of which
 * a percentage needs. The campaign page is the platform's most performance-sensitive route and
 * `performance/budgets.json` is what noticed.
 *
 * So the function moved to a leaf whose only dependencies are `decimal.js` and a type. It is the
 * same function with the same rounding rule, imported by both sides, which is the property that
 * mattered: two implementations of "what percent funded" is how a card and a page come to
 * disagree by one point.
