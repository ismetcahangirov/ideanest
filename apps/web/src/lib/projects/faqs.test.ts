/**
 * The FAQ form's rules — the editor half of #283.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER:
 *
 *   - **the service's bounds are met before the round trip, not instead of it.** §4.4 caps a
 *     question at 200 characters and an answer at 4000 and refuses a blank either side. A
 *     creator who pastes 4200 characters and is told so at once has lost nothing; one told by
 *     a refusal has lost the press. The service stays the authority — this is the first of
 *     two checks, never the only one.
 *   - **a patch carries only what changed.** A merge patch writing both fields back unchanged
 *     would move `updated_at` for nothing, and an empty one is not sent at all.
 *   - **the ends are trimmed and the middle is not.** Leading whitespace is not content; the
 *     line breaks inside an answer are the only structure plain text has, and the public tab
 *     renders them.
