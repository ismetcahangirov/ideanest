/**
 * §4.4's live countdown and its "deadline in the viewer's timezone" — the arithmetic half.
 *
 * <h2>Why the arithmetic is here and not in the component</h2>
 *
 * Two surfaces read the same instant and must never disagree about it: the countdown beside
 * the funding figures and the all-or-nothing sentence in the trust block. A campaign whose
 * header says "2 days left" beside a sentence naming a date that has passed is a page a
 * backer cannot trust with money. One function, two callers, and a test that can ask what a
 * campaign looks like ninety seconds before it closes without waiting for that minute.
 *
 * `CampaignPage.daysLeft` already exists and is deliberately not replaced. It is whole days,
 * floored at zero, computed on the server for the badge and the structured data; what §4.4
 * asks for in addition is a countdown that moves. The two are computed from the same
 * `deadline` string, so they cannot drift — the floor of {@link Remaining.days} is exactly
 * `daysLeft`.
 *
 * <h2>Time zones, and the hydration mismatch this file exists to avoid</h2>
 *
 * The server does not know the reader's zone. Nothing carries it: it is not in a header, and
 * the cookie that could carry it would make the page uncacheable, which is the whole
 * argument of §4.4's server-rendered read.
 *
 * So the deadline is formatted <strong>twice</strong>. The server formats it in UTC and puts
 * that in the HTML, labelled as UTC, so a reader with no JavaScript and a crawler both get a
 * real, unambiguous instant. After hydration the client reformats the same instant in the
 * zone the browser reports and swaps the text. Both go through {@link formatInstant} with the
 * same fixed locale, so the only thing that differs between the two renders is the zone —
 * which is the one thing that is allowed to differ.
 *
 * <strong>The locale is pinned rather than left to the browser.</strong> `Intl` with an
 * undefined locale resolves to the reader's, and a server that resolved to a different one
 * would produce a hydration mismatch on the date itself rather than on the zone. The
 * interface ships in English and Azerbaijani (§21.1) and the language is not chosen per
 * browser today; when it is, this constant is what a locale is threaded into.
