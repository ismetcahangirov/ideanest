 * boolean on the shared reader would make legible at the call site.
 *
 * <h2>The card is the same shape, deliberately</h2>
 *
 * The service answers with the same {@link ProfileProjectCard}, so the same narrowing runs
 * over it. What differs is `state`: the public lists carry nine of §6.1's sixteen and this
 * one carries all of them, which is the entire reason the endpoint exists.
