/**
 * The campaign page's tabs — §4.4's table, as addresses rather than as component state.
 *
 * <h2>A query parameter, and the two alternatives it beat</h2>
 *
 * §4.4 lists seven tabs on one page. Three ways to express that:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>Local state.</strong> `useState` in a client component that swaps the panel.
 *       Rejected outright, twice over. It makes the whole tab shell a client boundary on the
 *       one route #119 exists to keep server-rendered, and — worse — it makes the Comments
 *       tab unlinkable and uncrawlable. A creator who answers a question in the comments
 *       cannot send anybody to the answer, and a search engine is served a page whose
 *       updates and comments do not exist. The content is public and the endpoints behind it
 *       are `permitAll`; hiding it behind a click is throwing it away.
 *   <li><strong>A nested route per tab</strong> — `/projects/{creator}/{slug}/comments`.
 *       Linkable and crawlable, and still rejected. It multiplies one URL into five that
 *       differ by a panel, so every one of them needs a canonical pointing at the campaign
 *       and four of them are duplicate-content candidates until it does; it needs a layout
 *       to hold the header, which means the header's read is either repeated or lifted into
 *       a layout that cannot see the tab; and it adds four entries to
 *       `apps/web/performance/budgets.json`, which CI fails on in both directions.
 *   <li><strong>A query parameter</strong> — `?tab=comments`. One route, one budget entry,
 *       one canonical URL (`projectPageMetadata` already builds it from the path alone, so
 *       every tab points at the campaign), and a link that opens the tab it names. The tab
 *       list is `<a href>` elements, so it works with no JavaScript at all and a crawler
 *       follows it like any other link.
 * </ol>
 *
 * The cost of the third option is that switching tabs is a navigation rather than a repaint.
 * That is the right cost on this page: each tab is a separate public read, so a click was
 * always going to be a round trip, and Next serves it as an RSC payload rather than a
 * document.
 *
 * <h2>The default tab has no parameter</h2>
 *
 * `?tab=campaign` and the bare path are the same page, so the bare path is the only one this
 * module ever produces. One address for the default state is what keeps the canonical URL,
 * the sitemap entry and the link somebody pastes into a message from being three different
 * strings for one campaign.
 *
 * <h2>Four tabs, not seven, and the missing three are named</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Rewards</strong> is on the page rather than in the tab list. The tier list is
 *       the column beside the story (`CampaignRewards`), where it stays visible while a
 *       reader is deciding — moving it into a tab is its own issue, and doing it here would
 *       hide the reward tiers behind a click on every campaign for the sake of matching a
 *       table.
 *   <li><strong>FAQ</strong> has no endpoint. §10.2 names `GET /v1/projects/{id}/faqs` and
 *       the service does not publish it; a tab that always said "no questions yet" would be
 *       a claim about the campaign rather than about the platform.
 *   <li><strong>Community</strong> is blocked on #209, and §4.4 says why: a backer-statistics
 *       bucket below a minimum cell size identifies the person in it, and the minimum is a
 *       product and legal answer rather than an implementation detail.
 * </ul>

/**
 * Where a paged tab starts reading from.
 *
 * <h2>One parameter for two tabs, and why that is not a collision</h2>
 *
 * The Updates and Comments tabs are both cursor-paged, and exactly one of them is rendered
 * per request — the tab parameter decides which — so one name can serve both. Two names
 * (`updatesFrom`, `commentsFrom`) would be two parameters of which one is always dead, and
 * the dead one is the one that goes stale in a link somebody bookmarked.
 *
 * <h2>The value is the service's, unread</h2>
 *
 * An update cursor is an integer and a comment cursor is a UUID. Neither is parsed here:
 * they are carried from the `nextCursor` the service sent, through the URL, back to the
 * service. A client that looked inside either would be a client that breaks the day the
 * encoding changes — which is the argument `lib/community/signals.ts` already makes about the
 * same kind of value.
 *
 * <h2>Forward only, deliberately</h2>
 *
 * There is a link to the older page and none back to the newer one. A keyset cursor names
 * where to start, not where you came from, so a "newer" link would have to be built from a
 * history this page does not keep — and the browser already keeps it, correctly, under the
 * Back button.

/**
 * Which conversation to open in full — the Comments tab only.
 *
 * `GET /v1/projects/{id}/comments` publishes two reads on one route: without `thread` it is
 * the tab, a page of conversations each carrying a preview of its replies; with it, one
 * conversation and a page of that conversation's replies. The service's own controller argues
 * why it is a parameter rather than a second route — "the same resource with a narrower
 * question" — and the same argument decides it here.
 *
 * <strong>It is what makes "show more replies" a link.</strong> The alternative is a client
 * component that fetches the rest of a thread on a press, which would be a client boundary
 * per conversation on the route #119 exists for, and a reply nobody could link to.
