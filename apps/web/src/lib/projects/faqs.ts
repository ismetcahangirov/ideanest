/**
 * The FAQ form's own state, and the rules §4.4 refuses an entry against.
 *
 * Separate from `api.ts` for the same reason `rewards.ts` is: that module is the
 * shape of the wire and this is the shape of a half-typed form. A draft holds
 * the strings the controls hold, so that "  " is a thing a creator can be part
 * way through typing rather than a value the client has already decided is
 * invalid.
 *
 * <h2>The bounds are the service's, restated so the creator meets them first</h2>
 *
 * The service refuses a blank question, a blank answer, a question over 200
 * characters and an answer over 4000, with an RFC 9457 problem detail. Every one
 * of those is checked here too — not instead. A creator who pastes 4200
 * characters and is told so before pressing Save has lost nothing; one who is
 * told by a round trip has lost the press. The service stays the authority: when
 * it refuses anyway, its own sentence wins (`fieldErrorsFrom`).
