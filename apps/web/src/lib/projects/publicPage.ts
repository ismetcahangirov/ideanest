/**
 * The campaign page's view model — what §4.4's page actually renders.
 *
 * <h2>Why the generated type is not rendered directly</h2>
 *
 * `ProjectPageResponse` comes from the published contract, and every property on it is
 * optional: springdoc marks a field required only when it can prove it, and the service's
 * response records are plain Java records whose components are frequently nullable by
 * design. That is honest and it is not renderable — a page written against it would narrow
 * `title`, `slug`, `state` and fourteen others at every use, and the first component to
 * skip a check would print `undefined` into somebody's campaign.
 *
 * So the narrowing happens once, here, and produces a shape where the things a campaign
 * always has are not optional and the things it may genuinely lack are `null`. A response
 * missing one of the former is `null` overall rather than a partially built page — see
 * {@link readCampaignPage}.
 *
 * <h2>What is derived and what is read</h2>
 *
 * Nothing here invents a fact about a campaign. The two derived values — the completion
 * percentage and the days remaining — are arithmetic over fields the service sent, and both
 * are computed here rather than in a component so that the page and its structured data
 * cannot come to two answers about how funded a campaign is.
 *
 * **The percentage is a `Decimal`, never a number.** It is a ratio of two money values, and
 * §10.3's rule is about exactly this: the moment it becomes an IEEE 754 double it is a
 * percentage nobody can reproduce. `ProjectCard` reads the server's own `completionPercent`
 * the same way; this endpoint does not send one, so it is computed with the same library.
 */

/**
 * The states that have a campaign page — `PublicProjects.VISIBLE`, restated.
 *
 * <strong>This is deliberately NOT `isPubliclyVisible`, and the difference is not a
 * mistake in either of them.</strong> They answer two different questions and disagree
 * about exactly two states:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>`CANCELED` has a page and must not be described.</strong> Backers
 *       committed money to it and are owed the page that explains what happened;
 *       `isPubliclyVisible` refuses it because a social card is a presentation of a
 *       campaign to back, and this is not one.
 *   <li><strong>`SCHEDULED` is described and has no page here.</strong> Its public surface
 *       is the pre-launch route, which the service serves from a different endpoint; the
 *       campaign page 404s for it, because there is no campaign yet.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Two independent statements of one rule, checked against each other in a test, is the
 * arrangement the service already uses for the same list — `PublicProjects` and
 * `DiscoveryStatus` each write the nine down rather than deriving one from the other. The
 * alternative here is no statement at all, which would mean trusting a single service-side
 * check to be the only thing standing between a draft and the HTML.

 * lock — see {@link RENDERABLE_STATES}. The cost is a line; the cost of the leak is a
 * creator's unannounced project in somebody's search results.

 * <p><strong>The state check is the caller's, and there is exactly one caller that skips

 * the submission queue, and its whole purpose is to render a campaign the public cannot
 * see: a campaign in review is not public, which is what being in review means, so the

 *
 * <p>A parameter on {@link readCampaignPage} would have been the shorter change and the
 * wrong one. That function's own comment calls the state check "the second lock on the same
 * door", and a lock with an argument that opens it is one call site away from a draft in
 * somebody's search results. Two functions, one of which is named after the audience that
 * may use it, is what the service does for the identical problem — `PublicComments` answers
 * for strangers and `ModeratedContent` answers for staff, and neither can be mistaken for
 * the other.

 * campaign has is still `null` here, because a half-built preview is a decision taken
