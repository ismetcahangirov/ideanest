/**
 * What a category landing page needs, resolved once — §4.13 WS-05.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not written twice in two `page.tsx` files</h2>
 *
 * `generateMetadata` and the page component are two functions that each need the same
 * category, and there are two routes (a category and a subcategory) that each need both. That
 * is four resolutions of the same slug, and the failure mode of writing them separately is
 * specific and bad: a `generateMetadata` that resolved a category the page then 404s produces
 * a page with a real `<title>` and a not-found body.
 *
 * Next dedupes concurrent `fetch` calls for the same URL within one request, and both reads
 * below go through `lib/api/server.ts`, so calling this from `generateMetadata` and again from
 * the page costs one round trip rather than two.

 * put in the heading, no children to list, and no way to know the slug is real — so the
 * alternative is a page titled with a slug, listing whatever the service happens to return for
 * a filter nobody can confirm exists. A 404 is recoverable and a page that invents a category
 * is not.
 *
 * The campaigns are read even when the tree read fails, because they are independent and
 * concurrent; the result is discarded in that branch. Serialising them to avoid one wasted
 * request would add a round trip to every successful page, which is the common case.
