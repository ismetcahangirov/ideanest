/**
 * §4.11's AD-03: editorial collections, the badges they grant, open calls, and placement —
 * issues #300, #301, #302 and #303.
 *
 * <h2>Four issues, one endpoint set, and that is not an accident</h2>
 *
 * The four screens the epic asks for are four questions about the same table. V14 made that
 * choice deliberately and its own header says why: a staff selection, a themed list and an
 * open call all have a slug in a URL, translated copy, a publication decision, an optional
 * window, cover imagery and an edited sequence of campaigns behind them, and the kind is the
 * only thing that differs. So `/admin/curation` is the manager, `/badges` is the ones that
 * grant a badge, `/open-calls` is the ones with a window, and `/placements` is the order they
 * appear in — and every one of them reads {@link listCollections}.
 *
 * <h2>There is no delete, and there will not be one</h2>
 *
 * A collection anything has happened to cannot be hard deleted: `curation_events.collection_id`
 * has no `ON DELETE` clause, on purpose. Withdrawing one unpublishes it, which 404s to the
 * public and leaves the record of why intact. {@link unpublishCollection} is the whole of it.
 *
 * <h2>Every mutation carries a note, and the note is required</h2>
 *
 * Publishing, withdrawing, adding a campaign and removing one are all audited, and the
 * service refuses each without a reason. That is not a form validation this client invented —
 * it is `minLength: 1` in the contract, and the reason is that in a badge-granting collection
 * adding a campaign <em>is</em> §3.2's "apply an editorial badge", which is a decision
 * somebody may have to justify a year later.
