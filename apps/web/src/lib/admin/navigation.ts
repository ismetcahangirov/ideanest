/**
 * The administration console's sixteen modules — §4.11, issue #294.
 *
 * <h2>Why this file is a list of what does not exist as much as what does</h2>
 *
 * Epic #259's definition of done is that "every module in §4.11's table has either a screen
 * or an open blocker naming what it waits on". A navigation listing only the built screens
 * would satisfy the letter of that and lose the point: a console showing nine entries reads
 * as a console that is nine screens, and the fourteen absent modules become something a new
 * member of staff discovers by asking. So every module is here, each carries its state, and
 * the ones that are not built say what they are waiting for and which issue owns it.
 *
 * That is the opposite of the rule `components/shell/navigation.ts` states for the public
 * site — "it lists what exists, and nothing else" — and the difference is who is reading.
 * A visitor offered a link to a page that does not exist has been lied to. A member of staff
 * told that refunds are not built yet, and why, has been told something true and useful, and
 * the alternative is that they go looking for the screen.
 *
 * <strong>Nothing here renders as a link unless {@link ConsoleModule.href} is set.</strong>
 * A blocked module is text with a reason beside it. There is no href to forget to remove.
 *
 * <h2>Translated since #324, and the earlier decision is recorded rather than deleted</h2>
 *
 * This file used to argue that the console should stay English: that §21.1's catalogue is
 * for the product's readers, that the console's readers are the few people who operate the
 * platform, and that sixteen module descriptions in four languages would be four times the
 * strings to keep current for an audience that did not exist yet.
 *
 * That has been reversed deliberately. The platform is to be legible in all four of §21.1's
 * languages to everybody who uses it, staff included — a moderator who reads Azerbaijani is
 * not a different class of reader from a backer who does. So the words are
 * `admin.modules.*`, `admin.groups.*` and `admin.links.*`, keyed by the identifiers below.
 *
 * <strong>What is left here is structure, and only structure.</strong> A module's code, its
 * state, whether it has an href, which other screens belong to it, and which issue owns it:
 * every one of those is a fact about the platform rather than a sentence about it, and the
 * `waitingOn` note is the one that would rot fastest if it were duplicated per language
 * beside a state that lives here. It is not duplicated: the state decides whether a note is
 * looked up at all, and `console.test.tsx` asserts that every module the state marks
 * unfinished has one in every language.
