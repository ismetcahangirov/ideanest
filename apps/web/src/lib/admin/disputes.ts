/**
 * §4.11's AD-07: chargebacks — issues #68 and #308.
 *
 * <h2>There is no way to open one, and that is deliberate</h2>
 *
 * A chargeback is raised by a card network and arrives through a provider webhook. The
 * service has no endpoint that lets staff open one, so neither does this module: an
 * endpoint that could invent a dispute the network never made would be a case the platform
 * then answers, at a cost, against nobody.
 *
 * What staff can do is answer — add evidence, submit it, record the outcome.
 *
 * <h2>The deadline is the field this screen exists for</h2>
 *
 * Everything else on a dispute could be reconstructed from the provider. A deadline that
 * has passed cannot, and losing by default is the expensive way to lose. The queue is
 * ordered by it, and the screen counts down.
