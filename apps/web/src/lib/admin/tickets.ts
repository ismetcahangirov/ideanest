/**
 * §4.11's AD-10: support conversations with the account context they are about — issue #310.
 *
 * <h2>Why the platform has its own rather than a shared mailbox</h2>
 *
 * §4.11 asks for "tickets with user context and action history", and the second half is what
 * a mail client cannot do. A conversation about a pledge is read beside that pledge, the
 * account's standing, and every other ticket the same person has raised — so the subject has
 * to be a column rather than a sentence somebody pasted, and the history has to come back
 * with the ticket.
 *
 * <h2>Internal notes are in the thread and are never shown to the requester</h2>
 *
 * A note staff leave for each other is read in sequence with the rest of the conversation —
 * that is the point of it — so it is a flag on a message rather than a separate list. The
 * service filters; `readRequesterThread` is what a person uses to check what the other side
 * actually has in front of them before replying.
