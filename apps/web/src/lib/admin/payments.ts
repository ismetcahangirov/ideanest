 *
 * <h2>The outcome filter, and why the screen went without one</h2>
 *
 * <p>This comment used to say there was deliberately no filter on status, because "every
 * failed charge on the platform" is a real question with no index behind it and the screen
 * shows the status of every row it draws. #404 is what that cost: the log's own description
 * promises it includes rejected calls, failed provider calls are the main reason anybody
 * opens it, and they were the one view it could not select — so "the screen shows the status"
 * meant scrolling twenty-five successes to find one failure. The answer is the index.
 *
 * <p><strong>The outcome combines with the other two</strong>, unlike them with each other:
 * "what did this collection run leave behind" is a campaign and a status together, and the
 * campaign's own index serves it with the status as a filter step.
 *
 * <p><strong>A request naming both a pledge and a campaign is resolved to the pledge by the
 * service</strong>, which is the narrower question; the response echoes what it actually
 * applied. There is still deliberately no filter on provider, on type or on a date range —
 * `PaymentLogScope` on the service side records what each would cost.
