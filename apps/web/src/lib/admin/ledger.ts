 * every `transaction_id`, the debits equal the credits — so a list of rows would be a list in
 * which the platform's central accounting rule is invisible. The endpoint groups, and this
 * module keeps the grouping: {@link LedgerPosting} is the unit, and every posting carries all
 * of its sides even when an account filter matched only one of them.
 *
 * <p>That last clause is the reason the filter is safe to offer. A ledger that showed you the
 * escrow half of a double entry because escrow was what you filtered on would be showing a
 * balance that does not balance, which is the one thing this table exists to make impossible.
