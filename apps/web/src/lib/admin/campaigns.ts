/**
 * §4.11's campaign directory: what campaigns exist — issue #387.
 *
 * <h2>Why the console needed one</h2>
 *
 * <p>Three screens could reach a campaign and all three start from something the
 * campaign did: a report somebody filed about it, the submission queue it entered by
 * being submitted, and a suspension that takes an identifier a member of staff already
 * had. A campaign that is simply a draft, or simply live, or that was approved a week
 * ago and has been sitting unlaunched since, was in none of them — and the only way to
 * look one up was a psql session.
 *
 * <h2>Not the submission queue with the filter widened</h2>
 *
 * <p>`/v1/admin/moderation/submissions` is a queue: oldest first, keyed on the
 * transition that put each campaign in its state, and refusing any state that is not
 * one a moderator decides. This is a directory: newest first, every state, and the
 * funding figures rather than the last moderator's note. `CampaignDirectory` on the
 * service side carries the argument at length.

/**
 * One campaign, as its page reads, in whatever state it is in — issue #399.
 *
 * <h2>The link the submission queue was missing</h2>
 *
 * <p>That queue asks a moderator to approve, reject or send back a campaign, and the only
 * link on each card pointed at the public page. A campaign in review is not public — that
 * is what being in review means — so the link answered 404 by construction, and approval
 * happened on a title, a creator's name and a goal figure. Everything the creator actually
 * wrote was one screen away and unreachable.
 *
 * <h2>The same projection the public page is served from</h2>
 *
 * <p>`GET /v1/admin/projects/{id}` returns `ProjectPageResponse`, unchanged, without the
 * state filter that makes the public endpoint public. A moderator decides whether a
 * campaign may be published, so what they are shown has to be what publishing it would
 * show; a narrower preview would be a second description of the campaign, and the decision
 * would be taken against the description.
 *
 * <p>Narrowed by {@link readCampaignFields} rather than by `readCampaignPage`, which is the
 * one difference and is the whole reason that function exists — see it for why the public
 * reader's state check is not a parameter.
 *
 * @returns the campaign, or `null` when the response is missing something every campaign
 *     has. The screen renders that as "this could not be read" rather than as a page with
 *     holes in it: a half-built preview is a decision taken against a page that is not there
