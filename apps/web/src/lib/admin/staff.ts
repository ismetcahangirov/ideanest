/**
 * §4.11's role model in the browser — issue #295.
 *
 * <h2>What this replaces</h2>
 *
 * Until #295 the console had one question it could ask about the reader — none — and one
 * answer it could render: whatever the last endpoint refused with. Every screen was drawn,
 * every screen made a request, and a moderator who had no business with the ledger found
 * that out by opening it and reading a 403.
 *
 * `GET /v1/admin/me` is the endpoint that ends that. It is the only route under
 * `/v1/admin` that refuses nobody: a signed-in visitor who opens `/admin` out of curiosity
 * gets `staff: false` and a page that says so, where a 403 would leave the console unable
 * to tell "you do not work here" from "the service is down".
 *
 * <h2>The route is still not a gate</h2>
 *
 * <strong>Nothing here decides whether a page may be reached.</strong> The service refuses
 * every read behind every screen, and that check is the one that matters; this decides
 * what the console *offers*, which is a different question with a much lower cost of being
 * wrong.
 *
 * That is not a shortcut. `lib/api/access-token.ts` keeps the access token in a module
 * variable and the refresh token in a `SameSite=Strict` `HttpOnly` cookie that rotates on
 * every use — so a Server Component could only authenticate by spending that cookie, which
 * would invalidate the token the browser is holding and end the session it was checking. A
 * layout gate would therefore be a second, weaker copy of a check the service already makes
 * correctly, and the dangerous direction is the one where the browser says yes.
 * `AdminArea` has carried that argument since #294 and #295 does not reverse it.
