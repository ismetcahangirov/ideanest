 * account has backed (#404), the ban, and the way back from it.
 *
 * Every one of them returns an email address, which almost nothing else on this
 * platform does — the service audits each read for that reason and answers
 * `no-store`. Nothing here caches a response, and nothing here holds one outside
 * the component that asked for it.
 *
 * `POST .../reinstate` is not in docs/architecture.md §10.2's list and exists
 * because a ban with no reversal makes the first mistaken one permanent. A
 * campaign's suspension is terminal because its funding window has moved on; an
 * account has no window.
