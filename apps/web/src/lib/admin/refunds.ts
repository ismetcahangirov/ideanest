/**
 * §4.11's AD-06: sending money back — issues #67 and #307.
 *
 * <h2>The idempotency key is generated here and is not optional</h2>
 *
 * The service requires an `Idempotency-Key` header on the write, which is stricter than
 * most of §10.2 and is the right way round: a refund is the one mutation where a duplicate
 * is money leaving twice and where — unlike a duplicate charge — nobody complains about it.
 *
 * <strong>The key is made once per attempt and reused across retries of that attempt.</strong>
 * A key generated inside the request function would be a new key on every retry, which is
 * exactly the same as having none. `newRefundKey` is called by the screen when somebody
 * opens the form, and travels with the form's state.
 *
 * <h2>A null amount means "the rest of it"</h2>
 *
 * Not a `full` flag beside a number. The two can disagree: a console that computed the full
 * amount from a page loaded before an earlier partial refund would send a figure that is
 * both "full" and too large. Null makes the service compute it from the row it has locked.
