/**
 * §22.2's eight documents, from the console — issue #425.
 *
 * <h2>Publishing is not an edit, and the console has to say so</h2>
 *
 * A published version is immutable: V65 puts a trigger on the table, `LegalDocument` refuses
 * it above, and there is deliberately no entry point for it here. The reason is what an
 * acceptance is — `document_acceptances` names a version, and an acceptance of a text that
 * can be edited afterwards is evidence of nothing.
 *
 * So a correction is a new version, and the previous one stays readable because somebody who
 * accepted it is entitled to read what they accepted. `FeeEditor` makes the same argument
 * about a rate and reaches the same shape, one step stronger: a fee schedule is closed and
 * replaced, and a legal document is never even closed.
 *
 * <h2>A draft is per language; a publication is per document</h2>
 *
 * {@link writeDraft} takes a locale, because somebody writes one language at a time.
 * {@link publishDocument} does not, because a version is published in every language it has
 * been translated into under one number and one effective date — a publication that could
 * half-happen would leave days in which what a reader agreed to and what governed them were
 * different documents.
 *
 * And nothing publishes without the Azerbaijani text, which the service refuses with
 * `GOVERNING_TEXT_MISSING`: that is the text that governs, and the other three exist so a
 * person can read what they are agreeing to.
