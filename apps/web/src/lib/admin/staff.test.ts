 * What the console does with a role model — issue #295.
 *
 * <p>The interesting assertions here are about the two 403s. Before this epic there was one,
 * because there was one question: a caller was staff or was not. A moderator opening the
 * refund console got the same refusal as a stranger, which reads as a broken console rather
 * than as a screen that is not theirs — and the sentence somebody is shown decides whether
 * they go and ask an administrator for a role or go and file a bug.
