/**
 * AD-11's second half: what the platform charges a creator to publish.
 *
 * <h2>Filed under AD-11 rather than a seventeenth module</h2>
 *
 * §4.11's table has sixteen rows and the fee editor is the one about what the platform
 * charges. A fee comes out of a backer's pledge and this comes out of a creator's pocket, so
 * it is the same authority over the same subject — `lib/admin/navigation.ts` files it under
 * AD-11 the way `/admin/staff` is filed under AD-04, and a seventeenth row would make the
 * console and the specification disagree about how many modules there are.
 *
 * <h2>A plan is edited in place, which the fee schedule beside it is not</h2>
 *
 * That difference is worth carrying, because the two screens look alike and behave
 * oppositely. A rate may not be edited: a payout was priced against it, and §22.1 asks what
 * the rate was in March with a seven-year retention rule attached. A plan may be, because
 * what a subscriber was charged is copied onto their own subscription at purchase — so
 * editing a plan cannot reach backwards into anybody's bill.
 *
 * <p>What it does reach is the limits of everybody currently on the plan, which are read live.
 * The screen says so, because an operator lowering a limit should know who it applies to.
 *
 * <h2>There is no delete</h2>
 *
 * A plan leaves the catalogue by being unlisted. The service refuses a delete against any
 * plan anybody has ever bought, and a plan nobody bought is one nobody misses when it is
 * taken off sale.
 *
 * <h2>Money is a string, both ways</h2>
 *
 * `"19.00"`, never `19`. A JSON number is an IEEE 754 double in every mainstream parser.
