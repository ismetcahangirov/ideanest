/**
 * §4.11's AD-13: the platform's own figures — issue #313.
 *
 * <h2>Not the campaign dashboard</h2>
 *
 * `/v1/projects/{id}/analytics` is #95's and answers a creator asking about their own
 * campaign. This answers the platform's question with the same nouns, over the same daily
 * rollups summed the other way — which is what made #313 unblockable without a new table.
 *
 * <h2>What it does not answer, and says so</h2>
 *
 * AD-13 lists "volume, success rate, average pledge, cohorts, funnels". The first three are
 * here. Cohorts and funnels are not, and `notBuilt` carries the reason from the service so
 * the screen renders it rather than hard-coding a sentence that would go stale. Approximating
 * them would put two numbers on a dashboard that look like cohorts and funnels and are not.
