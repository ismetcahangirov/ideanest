/**
 * Uploading an image, from the creator's file to a servable one.
 *
 * Three calls and a poll, and the bytes go to object storage rather than through the API —
 * `POST /v1/media/uploads` issues a presigned address, the browser writes to it, and
 * `POST /v1/media/{id}/complete` says the bytes are there. See docs/architecture.md §13.1 and
 * the media pipeline design of 2026-08-30.
 *
 * WHY THE PUT IS A BARE `fetch` AND NOT `authorizedFetch`. The address is signed and goes to
 * a different origin; attaching this platform's bearer token to it would send a credential to
 * a host that has no business seeing one, and the store would reject the request for carrying
 * an `Authorization` header that is not part of the signature.
