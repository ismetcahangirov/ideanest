/**
 * The campaign's own questions and answers.
 *
 * <h2>What was checked before writing this, because the answer changed twice</h2>
 *
 * `FAQPage` used to produce a rich result — the expandable questions under a
 * search listing. In August 2023 Google restricted it to well-known
 * authoritative government and health sites, which IdeaNest is not. The
 * remaining eligibility was then withdrawn entirely: the feature stopped
 * appearing in Search on 7 May 2026 and the documentation for it has been
 * removed. **There is no rich result to earn here and this markup is not
 * emitted in the hope of one.**
 *
 * It is emitted because `FAQPage` is still a valid schema.org type, Google still
 * parses it to understand a page, and unsupported markup neither errors nor
 * costs anything. The campaign FAQ is a real, creator-authored surface (§4.4's
 * FAQ tab, `GET /v1/projects/{id}/faqs`), and describing it accurately is worth
 * doing for the consumers that are not Google.
 *
 * <h2>Only what the page shows</h2>
 *
 * The one guideline that survived every change is that the questions and answers
 * in the markup must be the ones visible on the page, and that `FAQPage` must
 * not be used for promotional copy. This function therefore takes the entries a
 * caller has rendered and nothing else — it does not fetch, it does not compose,
 * and it has no idea what a campaign's FAQ endpoint holds. A page that renders
 * no FAQ passes no entries and gets no node.
 *
 * **MOUNTED SINCE #283.** This paragraph used to say nothing mounted it, and that
 * was true for as long as the platform had nowhere to store a question: the tab
 * belonged to the server-rendered campaign page and the editor that fills it did
 * not exist. Both do now — `GET /v1/projects/{id}/faqs` is built, `CampaignFaqs`
 * renders the pairs, and `projectPageGraph` passes this function the same list.
 *
 * Writing it ahead of its caller was the point, and it paid off exactly as
 * intended: the page and this graph landed together rather than the page landing
 * first and the markup being remembered later — the same reason
 * `projectPageRobots` was written before anything rendered it.
 *
 * **The list it is given is the list the page renders, and that is a contract
 * rather than a coincidence.** The campaign page therefore reads the FAQ entries
 * on every tab rather than only on `?tab=faq`, which is the one place that route
 * departs from its own "only the active tab is fetched" rule. Gating the read on
 * the tab would empty this node on four addresses out of five and leave the
 * machine-readable half describing a campaign with no questions.
