/**
 * ONE GRAPH PER PAGE, COMPOSED HERE.
 *
 * The modules beside this one each know how to describe one kind of thing and
 * deliberately know nothing about where it is mounted. This is the only file
 * that decides which page claims what, so the answer to "what does a campaign
 * page say about itself" is one function rather than a component that a later
 * page forgets to copy — the same rule `lib/seo/metadata.ts` states for `<meta>`
 * tags, applied to the machine-readable half of the same job.
 *
 * <h2>EVERY BUILDER TAKES THE ROUTE'S LOCALE SINCE #123</h2>
 *
 * Not decoration. A graph names URLs, and every URL on this platform now carries a language
 * segment; a node that named the un-prefixed one would be pointing a crawler at a 307. It
 * also names the page's language outright on `WebSite`, and it names the fixed breadcrumb
 * steps in words — both of which were English constants on all four languages until this
 * change. Structured data that contradicts the visible page is worse than none, because a
 * search engine that catches it once has grounds to discount the rest.

 * page and asks for it on the home page or on one page describing the organisation, not on
 * every page. While there was no route at `/`, discovery was the entry page and the nodes
 * went there, with a comment saying so. There is one now.
 *
 * No breadcrumb. A trail on the page the trail starts from would be a single-item
 * `BreadcrumbList`, which `breadcrumbNode` refuses for the reason it gives — "you got here

/**
 * A campaign page's graph: the trail, its reward tiers, and its questions.
 *
 * **A campaign that could not be confirmed public produces an EMPTY graph** —
 * not a breadcrumb, not a title in a `ListItem`, nothing. That is the same lock
 * `projectPageMetadata` puts on the `<meta>` tags, in the same place in the same
 * order, and it is here for the same reason: the endpoint refuses a non-public
 * campaign, the reader refuses one that arrives anyway, and this refuses one
 * handed to it directly. A draft's title in a `BreadcrumbList` is a draft's title
 * in the HTML, whatever the `<title>` tag says.
 *
 * **The site identity is deliberately absent.** It is stated once, on the entry
 * page, and repeating it on every campaign would be two `Organization` nodes for
 * one organisation across the crawl.
 *
 * **MOUNTED SINCE #119**, on `app/projects/[id]/[projectSlug]/page.tsx`, which is
 * the server-rendered campaign page this was written ahead of. It is served the
 * same projection the page renders and the same tiers the page lists, so the
 * machine-readable and human-readable halves cannot describe two different
 * campaigns.
 *
 * **`faqs` CARRIES THE CAMPAIGN'S REAL QUESTIONS SINCE #283.** This paragraph
 * used to say the list was always empty because `GET /v1/projects/{id}/faqs` was
 * in §10.2 and unbuilt; it is built, and the campaign page reads it.
 *
 * That read is the one on that page which is NOT gated on the active tab, and
 * the reason is this function's own contract. `faqPageNode` takes "the pairs the
 * page actually renders", and the argument above — that the machine-readable and
 * human-readable halves cannot describe two different campaigns — is only kept
 * if the graph sees the same list on every address the campaign has. The graph
 * is emitted before the tab is chosen and every tab's canonical URL is the bare
 * path, so an `FAQPage` built only on `?tab=faq` would hang off the one address
 * no search engine indexes separately. `page.tsx` states this at its call site
 * as well, because it reads as a violation of its own "only the active tab is
 * fetched" rule and a later reader would otherwise correct it.
 *
 * A refused read still passes an empty list rather than a partial one, and
 * `faqPageNode` answers null for an empty list rather than emitting an `FAQPage`
 * with no questions in it — so a service that was restarting costs this graph a
 * node and never a wrong one.
