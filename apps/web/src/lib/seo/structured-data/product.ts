/**
 * THE `Product` ON A CAMPAIGN PAGE IS THE REWARD TIER, NOT THE CAMPAIGN.
 *
 * This is the decision in the whole directory that is worth getting wrong
 * loudly rather than quietly, so here is the argument in full.
 *
 * The obvious markup for a crowdfunding page is one `Product` for the campaign,
 * with an `Offer` whose price is the funding goal or the amount pledged. It is
 * also false in three separate ways. A campaign has no price — the goal is a
 * threshold and the pledged total is a running sum, and neither is a sum anybody
 * can pay to receive anything. It has no availability — Google's `Offer`
 * requires one, and every value in the enumeration would be a claim about stock
 * that a campaign does not have. And a `Product` whose `offers.price` is a
 * five-figure goal, on a page whose visible price is an 85 AZN tier, breaches
 * the structured data policy that markup must match what the page shows. That
 * combination — a price that is not the page's, an availability that is
 * invented, on a page that cannot be bought from — is the shape that earns a
 * manual action, and a manual action is applied to the whole site rather than
 * to the campaign that caused it.
 *
 * The reward tier survives every one of those objections. It has a price the
 * creator set and the page prints (§4.4's Rewards tab: "price, backer count,
 * shipping destinations, estimated delivery, remaining quantity"). It has a
 * quantity, so "sold out" is a fact rather than a guess. It is the thing a
 * backer chooses, and it is the only thing on the page that anyone commits money
 * to. One `Product` per publicly offered tier, each anchored to the campaign
 * page it is described on.
 *
 * <h2>`PreOrder`, and why nothing else is honest</h2>
 *
 * IdeaNest is all or nothing: nobody is charged unless the campaign reaches its
 * goal by its deadline (docs/architecture.md §4.5). A backer who selects a tier
 * has not bought anything and may never be charged at all. `InStock` would say
 * the opposite of that to every consumer that reads it. `PreOrder` is the one
 * value in `ItemAvailability` that describes money committed now for a thing
 * that does not exist yet — which is the literal definition of a pledge. A tier
 * whose last place is taken is `SoldOut`, which is true in any funding model.
 *
 * <h2>What is never claimed</h2>
 *
 * **No `aggregateRating` and no `review`.** The platform has no reviews. A
 * rating assembled from backer counts or funding percentage would be a
 * fabricated review signal, which is the specific thing Google's structured data
 * policy names as grounds for a manual action.
 *
 * **No `seller`.** The seller of a reward is the creator, and IdeaNest is the
 * escrow between them (§4.5). Naming the platform as the seller would move a
 * fulfilment obligation onto it in machine-readable form.
 *
 * **No stock figure.** `Offer.inventoryLevel` would be accurate for as long as
 * it takes somebody to back the tier. `lib/seo/metadata-card.tsx` refuses to
 * draw a backer count onto a social card for the same reason, and a number in a
 * cached document is a number that will be wrong.
 *
 * **No image the tier does not have.** The campaign's cover is the campaign's,
 * and naming it as the tier's product image would show a photograph of a
 * different thing beside the tier's price.
