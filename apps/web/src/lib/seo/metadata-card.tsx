/**
 * The social preview card, drawn rather than photographed.
 *
 * This is what `opengraph-image.tsx` renders through Next's `ImageResponse`, which
 * is Satori: a subset of CSS laid out with Yoga and rasterised to a PNG. It is not
 * a browser, so nothing here may reach for Tailwind, a custom property, or a
 * cascade — Satori resolves neither. **The colours therefore come from the
 * JavaScript form of the token file** (`@ideanest/design-tokens`), which exists for
 * exactly this case: "React Native and canvas/chart code, both of which need
 * literal values". A hex literal in this file would be a member of the palette
 * nobody agreed to (docs/ui-kit.md §10.1, CLAUDE.md §2).
 *
 * <h2>The cover photograph is deliberately not drawn onto it</h2>
 *
 * When a campaign has a cover image, `projectPageMetadata` names that image as the
 * preview and this card is never used — the creator's own photograph beats our
 * typography every time. This card is what a campaign with no cover gets, and it
 * does not try to embed one anyway: Satori decodes PNG, JPEG, and SVG, while
 * docs/architecture.md §13.1 serves AVIF first and WebP second, so an embedded
 * cover would be a broken image on most campaigns and a rasterisation failure —
 * mid-stream, after the response headers have gone out — on the rest.
 *
 * <h2>One weight, and why the kit's display weight is missing</h2>
 *
 * `ImageResponse` ships one bundled face at one weight. docs/ui-kit.md §5.3 asks
 * for 600 on a display figure, and asking Satori for a weight it does not have
 * gets a synthesised approximation that looks worse than the honest regular. The
 * hierarchy here is therefore carried by size, colour, and space — all three from
 * the kit — and the day General Sans and Inter are in the repository as files
 * (they are not; §5.1 is a recommendation), this file gains a `fonts` option and
 * the weights the kit actually specifies.
