 * WHETHER A CAMPAIGN MAY BE INDEXED — ONE PREDICATE, ONE FILE.
 *
 * The sitemap and the project page's own `robots` meta tag are two statements
 * about the same thing, and they have to agree: a page that says `noindex` while
 * the sitemap advertises it is a page a crawler is invited to and then turned
 * away from, and a page that is indexable but absent from the sitemap is a page
 * nobody finds. So the decision is made once, here, and both read it.
 *
 * The table below is derived from `docs/architecture.md` §6.1 — the sixteen
 * project states — and from §4.3, which says which of them discovery may return.
 * The service states the same split independently in
 * `az.ideanest.discovery.domain.DiscoveryStatus`: nine `PUBLIC_STATES` and seven
 * `HIDDEN_STATES`. Nothing here is guessed, and nothing here is a copy of the
 * transition table; it is a copy of the visibility rule only.
 *
 * THREE ANSWERS, NOT TWO. "Public" and "indexable" are different questions, and
 * collapsing them is how a cancelled campaign ends up either unreachable by a
 * backer who has the link or permanently in a search result.
