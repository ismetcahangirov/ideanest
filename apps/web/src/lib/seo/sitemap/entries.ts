 * The static pages.
 *
 * `/` WAS LISTED BEFORE IT EXISTED, on the argument that this list is the platform's public
 * URL contract (§4.4, §10.2) rather than an inventory of the routes that happen to be built.
 * #264 built it. `/categories` joins it as WS-05's index — the page every category landing
 * page hangs from, and the one a crawler walks to find them.
 *
 * WS-07's three static pages join it with #292. They are the pages a search for "is IdeaNest
 * legitimate" should be able to reach, which is exactly the query a sitemap exists to answer;
 * they are also the only routes on the platform whose content is entirely editorial, so a
 * crawler that finds them finds something worth indexing rather than a shell around a feed.
 *
 * `/collections` joins it with #266, on exactly the terms `/categories` did: it is D-08's index
 * and the only page on the site that links to a collection landing page. It is here rather than
 * in `DISCOVERY_PATHS` for the same reason `/categories` is — the index itself is a fixed route
 * whose address never changes, and the pages hanging off it are data, listed by
 * `discoveryEntries`.
 *
 * Nothing here claims a `lastModified`: these pages are code, their content
 * changes when this application is deployed, and this module has no honest way
 * to know when that was. An invented date — `new Date()`, say — tells a crawler
 * that every page changed on every crawl, which is the fastest way to have
 * `<lastmod>` ignored altogether.
 *
 * `/search` IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT and `/maintenance` with it. Both are `noindex` and both are
 * in `PRIVATE_PATH_PREFIXES`, and a sitemap must never advertise a URL robots.txt blocks —
 * the contradiction is reported in Search Console and resolved in the crawler's favour, which
 * means the whole file is trusted less.

 * The `discovery` segment: the feed, one entry per category and subcategory, and one per

 *
 * <h2>Why the taxonomy is read here rather than listed above</h2>
 *
 * §4.3 requires the taxonomy to be editable without a deployment, so a frozen array of a
 * hundred paths would be a sitemap that is wrong the first time an administrator renames
 * anything. The segment is already `force-dynamic` (`app/sitemap.ts` explains why), and
 * `fetchCategories` caches the read for an hour, so a crawl of several segments costs one
 * request to the service.
 *
 * <h2>The collections are read on exactly the same terms — #266</h2>
 *
 * A collection is created, published, and withdrawn by a curator through the admin console
 * (§4.11 AD-08's sibling), so the set of collection URLs is data in precisely the way the
 * taxonomy is. They are listed here rather than in `PAGE_PATHS` because they are not code, and
 * they belong in the `discovery` segment rather than a segment of their own because a
 * collection page is a list of campaigns — the same kind of URL as a category page, with the
 * same reason for existing.
 *
 * **AND ONLY THE ONES THE SERVICE ACTUALLY LISTS.** `GET /v1/collections` answers with the
 * published, in-window collections and nothing else, so an unpublished one cannot reach this
 * file. That matters more than it looks: a sitemap entry for a URL that answers 404 is a
 * reported error against the whole file, and here it would additionally be an announcement of
 * a collection the platform has not published — which is exactly what
 * `CollectionController`'s 404-not-403 rule exists to prevent.
 *
 * The two reads are concurrent, because they are independent and a sitemap segment that
 * serialised them would take two round trips to answer one request.
 *
 * <h2>A failed read is the feed alone, never an exception</h2>
 *
 * Both readers answer `null` when the service refuses or cannot be reached. A sitemap that
 * 500s is a sitemap Search Console reports as an error against the whole site; one that is
 * briefly shorter is a sitemap. `/discover` is always in it, so the segment is never empty.
 *
 * <h2>`daily`, like the feed</h2>
 *
 * `pathEntries` claims `daily` for every path it writes, and that is as true of a category or
 * collection landing page as of the feed: what changes on one is which campaigns are listed
 * and how far along they are, and both move every day. No `lastModified`, for the reason
 * `PAGE_PATHS` gives — nothing here knows when the page last actually changed.
