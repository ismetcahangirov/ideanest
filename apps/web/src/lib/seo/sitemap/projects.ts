/**
 * WHERE THE SITEMAP'S CAMPAIGNS COME FROM.
 *
 * `GET /v1/discover` with no filters, walked to the end of its cursor. It is the
 * only public listing endpoint the platform has (§10.2), and its unfiltered
 * result set is exactly `DiscoveryStatus.PUBLIC_STATES` — the nine states that
 * may appear on a public surface. The seven hidden ones are therefore already
 * excluded by the service, and `isIndexableProjectState` is applied here anyway:
 * this is the one surface where a leak cannot be recalled, and two independent
 * filters that must both fail before a draft is published are worth the line of
 * code.
 *
 * ## Why not `publicFetch`
 *
 * `lib/api/client.ts` is the right client for the browser and the wrong one
 * here, for three reasons that all point the same way. It issues a
 * SAME-ORIGIN RELATIVE request — `/v1/discover` — which is what makes the
 * `SameSite=Strict` refresh cookie work in a browser and what makes the request
 * unresolvable in Node, where `fetch` requires an absolute URL. There is no
 * server to be same-origin with while `next build` runs. And it reads the
 * in-memory access token, which on the server is a module variable shared by
 * every request and must never be attached to a crawl-facing read.
 *
 * So this reads the service directly at `IDEANEST_API_ORIGIN` — the same
 * variable `next.config.mjs` proxies the browser's `/v1` to, so there is still
 * one answer per environment to "where is the API". The response types are
 * imported from `lib/discovery/api.ts` rather than restated.
