 * into `og:title` where `og:site_name` already says it. Those mistakes are
 * invisible in review — nothing renders differently — and they are visible in
 * every shared link forever.
 *
 * There are exactly two shapes here, because there are exactly two kinds of page:
 *
 *   - `publicPageMetadata` — something a visitor with no session may read, and
 *     therefore something a crawler may index and an unfurler may preview.
 *   - `privatePageMetadata` — a checkout, a settings screen, an editor tab.
 *     `noindex, nofollow`, no canonical, and nothing to unfurl.
 *
 * Nothing here invents a fact about a campaign. Every string that describes one
 * comes from the campaign's own public projection, and a campaign whose state is
 * not public gets the private shape — see `isPubliclyVisible`.

 *     sent a visitor, never a document. Leaving one in a canonical splits a page
 *     across as many URLs as there are newsletters that linked to it.
 *   - **Pagination parameters** name a position in a feed. The cursor is
 *     deliberately not in the URL at all, so a `?cursor=` or `?page=` reaching
 *     this function came from somebody else's scroll or a crawler's invention.
 *
 * A page whose *content* genuinely varies with its query string would need its
 * own rule here, and there is none in this application today. The alternative —

 * — was measured and rejected: it opts the route out of static rendering, and
