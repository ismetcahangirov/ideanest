/**
 * Which filter emptied the feed.
 *
 * "No results" is the least useful sentence an interface can produce. It is
 * indistinguishable from "the platform has nothing", and the reader's only move
 * is to start undoing choices at random until something comes back. The panel
 * already holds the answer, so the empty state says it.
 *
 * HOW IT IS KNOWN. A facet count excludes its own dimension and applies every
 * other (`DiscoveryFacetsApiTests`), so the count beside a chosen value is
 * exactly how many campaigns that value would return under everything else the
 * reader picked. A chosen value counting zero is therefore a value that is
 * incompatible with the rest of the choice — and removing it is the move that
 * brings results back.
 *
 * WHEN NOTHING COUNTS ZERO the filters are jointly responsible rather than
 * individually, and the honest answer is to name all of them. This is the tag
 * case: tags are AND'd, so "handmade" and "ceramics" can each have campaigns
 * behind them while nothing carries both. Blaming one of them would be picking
 * a culprit at random and would send the reader to remove a filter that was not
 * the problem.
