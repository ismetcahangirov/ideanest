/**
 * The closed vocabularies `GET /v1/discover` defines, and the words this
 * interface puts on them.
 *
 * EVERY VALUE HERE IS COPIED FROM THE SERVICE, not invented. The spellings come
 * from `az.ideanest.discovery.domain` — `DiscoveryStatus`, `DiscoverySort`,
 * `CompletionBand`, `AmountBand` — and the binder refuses anything else with
 * `400 DISCOVERY_VALUE_UNKNOWN` rather than ignoring it, so a typo here is a
 * feed that never loads rather than a filter that quietly does nothing.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. The service declares more than it can serve, and
 * answers the difference with `DISCOVERY_OPTION_UNSUPPORTED` naming the issue
 * that owns it (`DiscoveryCapability`). A control that cannot work is worse than
 * no control: it is a promise the interface breaks the first time somebody uses
 * it. So this module lists only what the tier-1 implementation actually serves,
 * and the gaps are recorded below rather than rendered.
 *
 *   `sort=relevance`                 #44 — the composite ranking
 *   `sort=near_me`, `country`, `city` #47 — no location schema exists
 *   `showOnly=saved`                 no saved-projects table exists
 *   `showOnly=recommended`           #44
 *   `showOnly=featured`              #48
 *
 * `q` (free text) WAS on that list and is not any more: #43 built the search
 * vector and `?q=` now composes with every filter, every sort, the cursor, and
 * the facet counts. It arrives with a sort of its own — see `best_match` below.
 */

/*
 * THE WORDS MOVED TO THE CATALOGUE — issue #324.
 *
 * This module used to pair each value with the label a reader sees. The values are the
 * service's and stay: `DiscoveryValueBinder` refuses anything outside them with
 * `400 DISCOVERY_VALUE_UNKNOWN`, so a typo here is a feed that never loads rather than a filter
 * that quietly does nothing. The labels were copy, and they were the last English on the
 * platform's front door.
 *
 * They are `discovery.filters.{status,sort,completion,amount}` now, keyed by the same value,
 * and `lib/i18n/feed-copy.ts` reads them. A value with no word renders as the value itself,
 * which is what `labelOf` did.
