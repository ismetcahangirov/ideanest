/**
 * D-04's cursor-paginated feed, as a hook.
 *
 * WHY A CURSOR AND NOT AN OFFSET. `pledged_amount` moves continuously on a
 * funding platform, so a campaign promoted from the bottom of the order to the
 * top shifts every row below it — and under `OFFSET` the next page then returns
 * a card the reader has already seen. A keyset cursor shows a row that moves
 * once or not at all. The server's `DiscoveryApiTests` has the test that
 * justifies the design; this hook's job is not to undo it.
 *
 * THE END OF THE FEED IS AN ABSENT CURSOR, never a short page. A page that
 * comes back with fewer cards than were asked for is still followed by more
 * whenever `nextCursor` is present, and a client that stopped on a short page
 * would truncate a feed whose last page happened to be full.
 *
 * ONE REQUEST PER CURSOR, ENFORCED. A sentinel at the bottom of a grid crosses
 * the viewport repeatedly — a scroll that overshoots and settles, a window
 * resize, an image loading above it and pushing it back down — and every
 * crossing fires the observer again. Without the guard below the same page is
 * fetched three times and appended three times, which reads as duplicated
 * cards. Cursors that have been requested are remembered rather than merely
 * "am I loading right now", because the second crossing routinely arrives
 * between the response landing and React committing the state it produced.
