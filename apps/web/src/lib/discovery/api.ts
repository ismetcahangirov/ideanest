/**
 * The typed client for `GET /v1/discover` and `GET /v1/discover/facets`.
 *
 * ONE MODULE, ONE PLACE, the same rule `lib/projects/api.ts` states: every
 * discovery call the web application makes belongs here. Shapes come from
 * `DiscoveryResponses`; nothing here invents a field.
 *
 * `publicFetch`, NOT `authorizedFetch`. Discovery is the front door and is
 * `permitAll` — a visitor who has not registered is exactly the audience it
 * exists for, and `authorizedFetch` throws when there is no token, which would
 * make the feed unreachable for everybody it is for.
 *
 * NULL FIELDS ARE ABSENT, NOT NULL. The service serialises with
 * `default-property-inclusion: non_null`, so a campaign with no deadline has no
 * `daysLeft` key at all and the last page has no `nextCursor` key. Every
 * optional field is typed `?: T | null` so the two readings are the same thing
 * to a caller, exactly as the project client does it.
