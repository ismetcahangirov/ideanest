/**
 * The filter, sort, and range state of the discovery feed — and the URL it is
 * written to.
 *
 * THE URL IS THE STATE. D-12 asks for shareable filter URLs, and everything
 * that decides which campaigns are shown lives in the query string: a filtered
 * feed is linkable, survives a reload, and the back button undoes a filter
 * rather than leaving the page. React state holding the same thing would be a
 * second copy to keep in step, and the one that loses is always the URL.
 *
 * THE CURSOR IS NOT IN THE URL, and that is a decision rather than an omission.
 * Two reasons, and the second is the one that settles it:
 *
 *   1. A shared link should open a fresh first page. Somebody who pastes the
 *      feed they are reading into a message is sharing "campaigns in Games,
 *      ending soon", not "page seven of my scroll" — and page seven of somebody
 *      else's scroll is a feed that opens halfway down with no way to know what
 *      was skipped.
 *   2. A cursor is bound to the query it was issued for. `DiscoveryQuery`
 *      fingerprints the filters and the sort into it, and replaying one against
 *      a different filter set is answered `400 DISCOVERY_CURSOR_MISMATCH`. A
 *      cursor in the URL would therefore be a link that 400s the moment the
 *      recipient touched a filter — or, worse, an entry in the back stack that
 *      does.
 *
 * The parameter names and value spellings are the service's own
 * (`DiscoveryQueryBinder`); this module never invents one.
