/**
 * The two files that let a link on this site open the mobile application —
 * issue #114, the half that lives on the web.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a module and not two route handlers with literals in them</h2>
 *
 * Neither file can be a static asset. Both name an identifier that only exists
 * once an application has been signed — Apple's team prefix, and the SHA-256 of
 * the Android signing certificate — and both differ between the internal build
 * and the store build (`apps/mobile/eas.json`, issue #116). A literal here would
 * be one of those two, wrong for the other, and wrong in a way nothing fails on:
 * the operating system fetches the file, disagrees with it, and quietly stops
 * treating the link as a universal one. Nobody sees an error. The link just
 * opens the browser for ever.
 *
 * <h2>Unconfigured answers 404, and never a file</h2>
 *
 * A deployment that has not been told the identifiers serves neither file. That
 * is deliberate and it is the safer of the two failures: a 404 is what both
 * platforms already expect from a site with no application, and they retry. A
 * file served with a placeholder identifier is a file iOS caches — its CDN holds
 * an association for as long as a week — so a wrong one shipped once outlives
 * the deployment that fixed it.
