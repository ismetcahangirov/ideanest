/**
 * What arrives over §12.1's socket, and what a page does with it.
 *
 * This module is deliberately pure: no `WebSocket`, no React, no `window`. What it holds is
 * the two decisions worth testing — what a message from the server means, and what a running
 * total becomes when one arrives — and `useCampaignUpdates` is the thin part that owns the
 * connection.
 *
 * <h2>The socket is opt-in, and absent by default</h2>
 *
 * `next.config.mjs` states that the browser never learns the API's real origin: it talks to
 * this application, and `/v1` is rewritten server-side. **A WebSocket cannot use that
 * rewrite** — Next does not proxy an upgrade — so a live counter needs either an address the
 * browser can reach directly or a proxy in front of both, which is #139's territory.
 *
 * Rather than reverse that decision quietly, the address is a variable that is **unset by
 * default**: with nothing configured no socket is opened, no reconnection is attempted, and
 * the page behaves exactly as it did before #91 — server-rendered numbers that are correct and
 * refresh on navigation. A deployment that has somewhere to point this sets it, and the API's
 * `ideanest.realtime.allowed-origins` is the compensating control on the other side.
 */

/**
 * Where the browser may open a socket, e.g. `wss://api.ideanest.az`.
 *
 * **Not a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable**, and the difference is worth stating because the browser
 * does end up with the value either way. It is read on the server, by the campaign page, and
 * handed to the client island as a prop — so it is runtime configuration like
 * `IDEANEST_API_ORIGIN` rather than a string baked into a bundle at build time, and changing it
 * is a restart rather than a rebuild.
 *
 * Unset means the feature is off, which is the default.
