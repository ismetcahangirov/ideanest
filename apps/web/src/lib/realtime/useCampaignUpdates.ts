/**
 * Holds §12.1's socket open for one channel and hands back what arrives.
 *
 * The thin half of `lib/realtime/updates.ts`: everything worth testing is a pure function
 * there, and what is left here is a connection and its lifecycle.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing happens without an address</h2>
 *
 * `url` is `null` when `IDEANEST_REALTIME_ORIGIN` is unset, which is the default —
 * `updates.ts` explains why. This hook then opens nothing, retries nothing and re-renders
 * nothing, so the cost of the feature on a deployment that has not configured it is the bytes
 * of this file.
 *
 * <h2>Reconnection gives up, and that is the point</h2>
 *
 * Backoff doubles from a second to a minute, and after `MAX_ATTEMPTS` consecutive failures it
 * stops for good. A live counter that reconnected forever would be every abandoned tab on the
 * platform holding a connection attempt open against the service — and the page it is on is
 * already correct without it. The reader who wants fresh numbers reloads, which is the same
 * action they would take anyway.
 *
 * <h2>It never renders anything on its own</h2>
 *
 * The hook returns the accumulated updates and nothing else. It does not fetch, it does not
 * hold a total, and it does not know what a campaign is: the component that owns the
 * server-rendered numbers is the one that applies a delta to them, which keeps this reusable
 * for the comments tab without it learning about money.
