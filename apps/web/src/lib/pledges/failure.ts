/**
 * A refusal from the pledge module, in words a backer can act on.
 *
 * <h2>Why the wording is ours here and the service's on Discovery</h2>
 *
 * `DiscoveryView` renders the service's own `title` and `detail` and says why:
 * the endpoint knows which of its rules refused the request and the client does
 * not. Checkout is the other case. Every refusal this surface can meet is named
 * — six on the draft and two on the confirm from the contract, and the four #52
 * added to both (#204) — and each of them has a
 * DIFFERENT RECOVERY: one wants a different tier, one wants a different country,
 * one wants a new reservation, one wants the amount changed, and one wants the
 * backer to go and look at the pledge they already have. A sentence that is
 * accurate but does not say which of those to do is a dead end on the screen
 * where somebody is trying to give money.
 *
 * So the heading is ours, chosen with the recovery, and the service's `detail` is
 * kept underneath it when there is one — it is the half that names the tier, the
 * country, or the amount, and it is written by the code that knows which. Nothing
 * branches on `detail`; `code` is the only thing matched against (§10.4).
 *
 * <h2>The pledge manager reads this table too, and it is still one table</h2>
 *
 * #287 added §4.5's PL-09 edit and PL-10 cancellation, which raise four codes checkout never
 * sees (`PLEDGE_NOT_EDITABLE`, `PLEDGE_NOT_FOUND`, `REWARD_NOT_FOUND`) and re-raise several it
 * does. A second table keyed by endpoint was the alternative and it is the wrong shape: the
 * codes are properties of the pledge module rather than of the screen that met them, and
 * `PROJECT_NOT_LIVE` from a cancellation means precisely what `PROJECT_NOT_LIVE` from a draft
 * means. What did change is one sentence — that entry used to say "nothing was reserved",
 * which is a claim about a request only checkout makes.
 *
 * `CheckoutFailure` keeps its name, because roughly a dozen files import it and renaming a
 * type is a large diff whose only effect is to make a later reader wonder what changed about
 * the error handling. Nothing did.
