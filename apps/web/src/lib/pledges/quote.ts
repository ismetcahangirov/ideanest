/**
 * PL-06's total, computed on the client so the figure moves as the backer
 * chooses.
 *
 * <h2>THIS IS A PREVIEW. THE SERVER'S QUOTE IS THE AUTHORITY</h2>
 *
 * Every number this produces is replaced by `PledgeResponse.amounts` the moment
 * the draft comes back, and the checkout never adds the two together or prefers
 * one field of one to one field of the other. The reason is not politeness about
 * layering: the client is working from a reward list it fetched some seconds ago,
 * and a price, a rate or a tier's availability may have changed since. The server
 * quotes against the row it is about to reserve, inside the transaction that
 * reserves it. So this exists to make the figure respond to a keystroke, and it
 * stops existing the instant a real one is available.
 *
 * <h2>It mirrors `PledgeQuote` line for line, on purpose</h2>
 *
 * The rules below are `az.ideanest.pledge.domain.PledgeQuote.of` — already merged
 * by #194 — restated in `decimal.js`:
 *
 *   - **base** is the tier's price, or, with no tier, the whole contribution.
 *     Not zero-with-everything-as-bonus: that would make every report of "raised
 *     through rewards versus raised as support" read a support-only pledge as a
 *     bonus on a reward nobody took
 *   - **bonus** is `contribution - base`, and a negative one is a refusal rather
 *     than a clamp — clamping would quietly charge the higher figure, which is
 *     more than the number the backer was looking at
 *   - **add-ons** are the sum of price × quantity
 *   - **shipping** is summed over every shipped line: the first unit at the
 *     destination's rate, each unit after it at the additional rate
 *   - **tax** is zero until #78, from `TaxPolicy.NONE`
 *   - **total** is the five added up, which is what §7.2's generated column does
 *
 * A preview that used a different rule would be worse than no preview, because
 * the backer would see one number, press the button, and be shown another.
 *
 * <h2>No floating point, anywhere</h2>
 *
 * Every amount arrives as a string and is read with `Decimal` (CLAUDE.md §3).
 * Quantities are counts rather than money — a whole number of mugs — and they
 * reach the arithmetic only as the operand of `Decimal.times`, which is exact for
 * an integer.
