/**
 * The backer's own pledges, as a list — §4.5 PL-09 and PL-10, issue #287.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a second module beside `./api.ts`</h2>
 *
 * `./api.ts` is the pledge *resource*: the draft, the confirm, the read, the edit, the cancel,
 * all keyed on one pledge, all speaking `PledgeResponse`. This is a different projection with
 * a different shape and a different audience — `GET /v1/me/pledges` answers with a summary
 * that carries the **campaign** beside each pledge and does not carry its add-ons, its
 * supplements or its shipping country. Folding it into the resource client would put two
 * unrelated wire types called "a pledge" in one file, and the first bug would be a screen
 * reading `amounts` off whichever one it happened to have.
 *
 * <h2>The list is the only place a pledge knows which campaign it is</h2>
 *
 * `PledgeResponse` carries a `projectId` and nothing else about the campaign — no title, no
 * slugs — and there is no public read keyed on a campaign id alone: `/v1/projects/{creatorSlug}/{projectSlug}`
 * needs two slugs, and `/v1/projects/{id}/prelaunch` answers only for a campaign that has not
 * launched. So the summary on this list is the one projection that can name a campaign a
 * backer has pledged to, and `findMyPledge` below is what the pledge page uses to get it.
 *
 * **That is a stopgap and is written down as one.** The proper fix is a campaign on
 * `PledgeResponse`, which is a service change this pull request does not make. What it costs
 * is bounded and explained at `findMyPledge`.

 * beyond an identifier (see the module comment). The pledge page needs the campaign's **name**
 * for a reason that is not decoration: it offers to cancel a pledge, and a destructive
 * confirmation that cannot say what it is cancelling is a confirmation that has not confirmed
 * anything. §4.5's PL-10 releases reserved stock; a backer must know whose stock.
 *
 * So the page asks the one endpoint that knows, and asks it the only way it can be asked.
 * The proper fix is a campaign projection on `PledgeResponse`; until then this is bounded, it
 * is honest about being bounded, and **`null` is not a failure** — the page renders the pledge
 * without a campaign heading and still names the reward and the amount in the confirmation.
 * Refusing to show a pledge because its campaign could not be named would be a worse answer
 * than showing it.
 *
 * A refusal from the list propagates rather than being swallowed: a 401 here is somebody
 * whose session ended, and the page has to know that rather than render a pledge with a
 * missing title.
