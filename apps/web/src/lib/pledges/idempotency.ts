/**
 * Idempotency keys for the payment mutations — §10.3, PL-14.
 *
 * <h2>The rule, and why it is the most important detail in this client</h2>
 *
 * `Idempotency-Key` is required on `POST /v1/pledges/draft`, `POST
 * /v1/pledges/{id}/confirm`, `PATCH /v1/pledges/{id}` and `DELETE
 * /v1/pledges/{id}`. A replayed key returns the ORIGINAL response — same status,
 * same body — and keys are retained for twenty-four hours (§17.2).
 *
 * All of that is worth nothing if the client mints a fresh key per attempt.
 * Consider the failure the mechanism exists for: the request reaches the server,
 * the server reserves stock and writes a pledge, and the response is lost on the
 * way back — a dropped connection, a sleeping laptop, a proxy timing out. The
 * browser reports a network error and the backer presses the button again. With a
 * fresh key that second request is a second pledge. With the same key it is the
 * first one, answered from the server's record of it.
 *
 * **So a key belongs to an INTENT, not to an attempt**, and this module is the
 * only place that decides what an intent is.
 *
 * <h2>What counts as the same intent</h2>
 *
 * The body. Two requests that would create the same thing are the same intent;
 * two requests that differ in any field are not, and reusing a key across them
 * earns `409 IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED` — the server's own guard against a client
 * that thinks a changed selection is a retry. So the intent is keyed on a
 * canonical serialisation of the request body rather than on a hand-written
 * label, which makes "the same intent" an objective fact about the request
 * instead of a judgement a caller has to remember to make.
 *
 * <h2>When a key must be RETIRED</h2>
 *
 * Exactly one case, and it is not obvious: **the reservation expired**. A draft's
 * five minutes elapse, the backer presses "start again", and the body is
 * identical to the one that produced the expired draft — same tier, same add-ons,
 * same amount. Replaying the key would hand back the very draft that just
 * expired, and the checkout would loop. A new reservation after an expiry is a
 * NEW intent that happens to look like the old one, so the key is retired and the
 * next request mints a fresh one. `retire` exists for that, and for the mirror
 * case of `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`, where the server has told us the key is spent.
 *
 * <h2>What this deliberately does not do</h2>
 *
 * The keys live in memory, so a page reload starts over with new ones. Persisting
 * them across a reload would extend the guarantee to "the backer reloaded because
 * it looked stuck and tried again", which is a real case — but it also puts a
 * payment identifier into `sessionStorage`, where it survives being logged out,
 * and it fails in ways storage fails. The backstop for that case is the server's:
 * §7.2's unique index gives one active pledge per backer per campaign, and the
 * second attempt is refused with `PLEDGE_ALREADY_EXISTS` rather than duplicated.
 * That refusal is rendered as what it is (see `./failure`).
 */

/**
 * A canonical string for a request body: object keys sorted, at every depth.
 *
 * `JSON.stringify` alone would be enough for the bodies this client builds, since
 * it builds them itself in a fixed order — but "enough today" is how a
 * duplicate-charge bug is written. `{tier: 'a', qty: 2}` and `{qty: 2, tier: 'a'}`
 * describe the same pledge and must produce the same key, and a later refactor
 * that reorders a literal must not silently become a second charge.
 *
 * `undefined` is dropped exactly as `JSON.stringify` drops it, so a field the
 * caller omitted and a field it set to `undefined` are the same intent — which is
 * also what the wire sees.
