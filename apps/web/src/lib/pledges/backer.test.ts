/**
 * The backer's own pledge list — §4.5 PL-09 and PL-10, issue #287.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER:
 *
 *   - **`findMyPledge` is bounded.** It exists because `PledgeResponse` carries a `projectId`
 *     and no campaign, and it walks a paginated list to find one row. An unbounded walk is a
 *     page that makes forty requests for a heading; a walk that stopped after one page would
 *     lose every pledge older than twenty-four. The bound is behaviour, so it is tested.
 *   - **not finding it is not a failure.** The pledge page still renders, edits and withdraws
 *     without a campaign name, and a `null` that were an exception would take the screen down.
 *   - the list is read with the session, because every row is somebody's own money.
