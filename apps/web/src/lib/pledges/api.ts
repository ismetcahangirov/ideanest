 * The typed client for the backer's pledge endpoints.
 *
 * ONE MODULE, ONE PLACE, the rule `lib/projects/api.ts` states and
 * `lib/discovery/api.ts` repeats: every `/v1/pledges` and public-reward call the
 * web application makes belongs here, and #56's edit and cancel add functions to
 * this file rather than starting a second client. Two clients drift, and the
 * second one is always the one that forgets that money is a string.
 *
 * Shapes come from the epic #50 pledge API contract, which was derived from
 * docs/architecture.md §4.5, §7.2, §10.2, §10.3 and §10.4. Nothing here invents
 * a field.
 *
 * NULL FIELDS MAY BE ABSENT RATHER THAN NULL. The service serialises with
 * `default-property-inclusion: non_null`, so a tier with no limit has no
 * `limitQuantity` key at all while the contract's example prints it as `null`.
 * Every optional field is typed `?: T | null` so the two readings are the same
 * thing to a caller — the same decision both existing clients took.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE CHARGES A CARD, and nothing here can. §9.2's phase 1 —
 * verification authorisation, 3-D Secure, store the token, void — belongs to
 * #55, which is blocked on #60 (`status: needs-decision`), so there is no
 * provider to call. Confirmation performs the state transition and commits the
 * stock, and that is all it does.
