/**
 * §4.2's account navigation — issue #275.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER:
 *
 *   - **every entry points at a route this application serves.** `components/shell/navigation.ts`
 *     has the same test for the same reason, and it matters more here: an account navigation is
 *     exactly where somebody adds the entry before the page.
 *   - **every entry is behind the session guard.** Each of these screens reads one person's own
 *     data, so a path that `requiresSession` does not match is a path an anonymous visitor
 *     reaches and gets a wall of 401s on.
 *   - the current-page match is exact. A prefix match would be a second answer to a question
 *     `isCurrent` already answers differently for the site header, and the difference is
 *     deliberate.
 *   - **every key resolves in all four languages** (§21.1, #324). The entries stopped being
 *     English sentences and became addresses into `messages/*.json`, which moves the way this
 *     list breaks: not a label that reads badly, but a label that is not there. A missing
 *     Turkish string renders `account.links.language.label` in production — `i18n/request.ts`
 *     chooses that over a 500 — and nothing else in the suite would notice.

   * its expectation from the thing under test would pass for any navigation at all.
