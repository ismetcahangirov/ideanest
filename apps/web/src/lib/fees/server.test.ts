/**
 * §22.3's fee disclosure, narrowed — issue #439.
 *
 * <p>The property under test is the one the whole endpoint exists for: <strong>nothing
 * configured must never become zeros.</strong> The copy this replaced said the platform charges
 * zero commission, which was true only because no schedule is seeded and would have become false
 * the day one was. A client that turned a null rate into `0` would have reintroduced exactly
 * that defect one layer further out.
