/**
 * §22.3's sixth product requirement, read — issue #439.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is derived and not written down</h2>
 *
 * The platform's fee copy used to be a sentence saying that every payment is priced at zero
 * commission. That was *true*, because no schedule is seeded — and it would have become **false
 * the day one was**, silently, because nothing checks a message catalogue against a table.
 *
 * A number a creator can check against the payout they get is a disclosure. A sentence about the
 * platform's intentions is not. So this reads `GET /v1/fees/disclosure`, which resolves the
 * schedule in force, and `FeeDisclosureApiTests` asserts that the answer changes when the
 * schedule does.
 *
 * <h2>`configured: false` is an answer, and it is not zeros</h2>
 *
 * The two are different statements: zeros are a commitment to charge nothing, and an empty
 * table is the platform not having decided. The service is careful to send nulls rather than
 * zeros for exactly that reason, and this module carries the distinction through rather than
 * flattening it — a page that printed "0% platform fee" on the strength of an empty table would
 * be making a promise nobody authorised.
 *
 * <h2>The rates are strings all the way to the screen</h2>
 *
 * CLAUDE.md: money crosses the API as a string, never a number. A rate is worse than money in
 * one respect — it is *multiplied* by money — and a JSON number is an IEEE 754 double in every
 * mainstream parser, so `0.05` would arrive as `0.05000000000000000277…`. Nothing here parses
 * them; formatting is the component's job and does it through `decimal.js`.
 *
 * <h2>Filed under {@link PLANS}</h2>
 *
 * The same tag the subscription catalogue uses, and for the same reason: both are things the
 * platform charges, both change a handful of times a year, and both are written from one
 * console screen. A tag of its own would be one more thing the service has to remember to send
 * when a rate moves.
