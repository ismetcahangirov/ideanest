/**
 * What the inbox and the settings page ask the service — §4.10, and #88 and #89.
 *
 * <h2>Browser reads, both of them</h2>
 *
 * `lib/api/server.ts` is for #119's public pages and sends no token on purpose. Neither of
 * these is public: one is a person's own inbox and the other is their own settings, both
 * behind a bearer token, and the service answers the inbox with no validator at all —
 * `NotificationInboxResponse` explains why an ETag on a body that changes the moment you
 * read a row would only be a header. So both are fetched after hydration, like the
 * dashboard.
 *
 * <h2>The types are the contract's, narrowed</h2>
 *
 * springdoc marks every field optional because Java has no way to tell it otherwise, but
 * both responses are serialised with `JsonInclude.ALWAYS` — every key is present, and a
 * null is written as null rather than omitted. Narrowing here rather than guarding at every
 * use site is the same choice `lib/dashboard/api.ts` made, and the reason is the same: a
 * screen full of `?.` hides which fields genuinely can be absent. Only `readAt`,
 * `subjectType`, `subjectId` and the two cursor halves can, and those stay optional.
