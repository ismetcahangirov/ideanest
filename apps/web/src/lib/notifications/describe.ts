/**
 * What one notification says, and where opening it goes — #88.
 *
 * <h2>The copy lives here, not in the component</h2>
 *
 * A row is a sentence, and the sentence depends on the type and on what the rendering
 * document happens to carry. Keeping that in a pure function is what lets it be tested
 * against every type without mounting anything, which matters because there are
 * twenty-two of them and thirteen have no producer yet — a template that renders a hole is
 * discovered here rather than by whoever eventually receives the first one.
 *
 * The wording deliberately echoes `messages.properties`. A notification a person reads in
 * the inbox and then again in a digest email should not be two different sentences about
 * the same thing.
 *
 * <h2>`params` is a string, and it is parsed exactly once</h2>
 *
 * The service emits the `jsonb` column verbatim rather than re-serialising it, so what
 * arrives is text. Every read below goes through {@link readParams}, which never throws:
 * a document that cannot be parsed produces a row with the campaign missing rather than an
 * inbox that fails to render. Money is read as the API's `{amount, currency}` object and
 * formatted by `lib/money`, never by `Number()`.
