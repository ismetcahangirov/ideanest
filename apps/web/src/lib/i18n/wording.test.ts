/**
 * The English catalogue says what the components used to say — issue #324.
 *
 * <h2>The failure this exists for, which happened</h2>
 *
 * Moving a sentence into the catalogue is a copy-and-paste, and copy-and-paste through a
 * human is lossy. Writing the campaign page's keys, three sentences came out subtly
 * different from the ones that had been on screen: `campaign.faqs.empty` lost "add the
 * answer" in favour of "answer it", `campaign.comments.signedOut` dropped the clause
 * explaining that it is also how the creator replies to you, and
 * `campaign.comments.withdrawWarning` said a withdrawal "cannot be undone" where the
 * original said it "cannot be edited or restored".
 *
 * None of those is a typo. Each is a different sentence that reads as fluent, passes every
 * other check in this repository, and quietly changes what the product tells somebody. The
 * third was caught only because a test happened to assert the old wording; the first two were
 * caught by comparing against `git show origin/main` by hand.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is narrow rather than general</h2>
 *
 * It cannot check every string: most were moved out of JSX where the original no longer
 * exists to compare against. What it can do is pin the sentences the repository had already
 * decided were worth pinning — the ones a module exports as a constant precisely so that a
 * test can hold them still. Those are the promises about money, which is where a reworded
 * sentence costs the most.
