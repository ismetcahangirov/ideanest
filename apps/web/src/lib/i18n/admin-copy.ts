/**
 * Every word the administration console's frame draws — issue #324.
 *
 * <h2>The decision this file records</h2>
 *
 * `lib/admin/navigation.ts` used to argue that the console should stay English, on the
 * grounds that §21.1's catalogue is for the product's readers while the console's readers
 * are the few people who operate the platform. That is reversed: the platform is to be
 * legible in all four languages to everybody who uses it, staff included. A moderator who
 * reads Azerbaijani is not a different class of reader from a backer who does.
 *
 * <h2>What this covers, and where the rest of it lives</h2>
 *
 * The frame: the bar, the rail, and the index that lists §4.11's sixteen modules with what
 * each is waiting for. The twenty-six screens inside it are translated too, and their copy is
 * in `lib/i18n/admin/` — one module per group of the rail, resolved by
 * `lib/i18n/admin/console.server.ts` and handed to each screen as a prop.
 *
 * <p>This file stays separate from those because the frame is the one part of the console
 * that is drawn on every route, and because it is keyed by the identifiers the rail itself is
 * built from rather than by a screen's name.
 *
 * <h2>Keyed by the identifiers rather than by a name of its own</h2>
 *
 * A module's words are looked up by its §4.11 code and a rail entry's by its href. Both are
 * already the identifier the specification, the issues and the router agree on, so there is
 * no third name to keep in step — and a destination added to the rail without a label is a
 * missing key rather than a silently English one.
