/**
 * The words the campaign page's three client controls draw — issue #324.
 *
 * <h2>Why only three</h2>
 *
 * Ten of the thirteen components on this page are server components and read the catalogue
 * directly; there is nothing between them and the request, so a prop would be ceremony.
 * These three cannot: `CampaignActions` holds save and reminder state, and the two comment
 * controls own a composer and a confirmation. Their server parents resolve the words and
 * hand them over, which is the pattern `lib/i18n/shell-copy.ts` measured a provider against.
