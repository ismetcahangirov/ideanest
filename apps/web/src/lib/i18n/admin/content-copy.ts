/**
 * The words the console's content screens draw — issue #324, epic #259.
 *
 * The rail's first group: the moderation queue, the content and profile queues over it, and
 * one report's own page.
 *
 * <h2>Why the shared vocabulary is its own object rather than more fields</h2>
 *
 * Four components draw the same nine reasons, four target nouns, three states and five
 * decision verbs — the queue, the card inside it, the dialog all three open, and the detail
 * page. Spreading those into each screen's copy would give four copies of one table and three
 * chances for one of them to be given a translation the others do not have.
 *
 * <p>{@link ModerationCopy} is therefore passed down as a nested object rather than flattened
 * in, which is the one place in this directory that happens. It is the difference between a
 * screen's own words — which nothing else says — and the platform's moderation vocabulary,
 * which every one of these surfaces says identically.
 */

/**
 * The vocabulary of a complaint.
 *
 * <h2>Three tables for the target noun, and each earns its place</h2>
 *
 * `target` is the bare noun in the case these sentences put it in — "the report about
 * <em>campaign</em> 1a2b3c4d". `targetOnThis` is the whole prepositional phrase — "on this
 * campaign" — because Russian agrees the demonstrative with the noun's gender and
 * <em>эту кампанию</em> beside <em>этот комментарий</em> cannot be built from a shared "this".
 * `campaignName` is the nominative, for the three campaign verbs whose sentences make the
 * campaign the subject: "campaign 1a2b3c4d is cleared for launch" needs <em>кампания</em>
 * where "the report about campaign 1a2b3c4d" needs <em>кампанию</em>.
 *
 * <p>English distinguishes none of the three and would have been served by one table, which is
 * exactly why the old code had one. A translation surfaced the distinction the source language
 * hid.
 *
 * <h2>The state is keyed three ways for the same reason</h2>
 *
 * `state` is the tag beside a report. {@link ModerationQueueCopy.heading},
 * `emptyTitle` and `noticeReport` are whole sentences keyed by state rather than one sentence
 * with the state interpolated: "Upheld" is an adjective in the tag, a plural attributive in
 * "Upheld reports" and a past-tense verb in "Upheld the report about…", and Russian spells
 * those three differently.
 */
