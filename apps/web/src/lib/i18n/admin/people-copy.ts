/**
 * The words the console's people screens draw — issue #324, epic #259.
 *
 * The rail's third group: the account directory, the support queue and the staff roster.
 *
 * <h2>Two of these keep refusals of their own</h2>
 *
 * `UserDirectory` and `StaffRoles` say something the shared table does not — one names the
 * directory and what searching it costs, the other explains that reading the roster needs a
 * capability the reader has not got. Both said that before #324, and translating a surface is
 * not the change that gets to reword it.
 *
 * <h2>The wire words that stay</h2>
 *
 * A capability is rendered as its own identifier — `ISSUE_REFUND` — with the translated
 * sentence on its `title`. That is deliberate: the identifier is what a member of staff asks an
 * administrator for and what the service's refusal names back at them, so a translated chip
 * would be a word nothing else in the system answers to. The roles, which are four and are read
 * as ordinary nouns, are translated.

 * and a fallback string concatenated in JSX, and the two languages that put the verb last could
