/**
 * The words every console screen repeats — issue #324, epic #259.
 *
 * <h2>Why the refusals are one table rather than a table per screen</h2>
 *
 * `lib/admin/refusals.ts` already made this argument about the code and it applies unchanged
 * to the copy: twenty-six screens meet the same four outcomes — it worked, the browser has no
 * session, the account is not staff, or something else went wrong — and twenty-six copies of
 * those sentences means the twenty-fifth is the one nobody teaches about a new refusal code.
 * One table, keyed by §10.4's codes, so a code the service adds is a key somebody adds once.
 *
 * <h2>There are two 403s, and #400 is what it costs to render only one of them</h2>
 *
 * `StaffDirectory.requireCapability` separates them deliberately — "a stranger is told they do
 * not work here; a colleague is told which authority this screen wanted" — and the console
 * rendered `forbiddenBody` for both. So a moderator opening the payout queue was told they were
 * not a moderator, on a screen they had reached from a console that had just loaded the
 * moderation queue for them, and the sentence went on to explain a role model the platform
 * replaced in #295. Three wrong statements in four lines, in front of somebody who had done
 * nothing but open a URL.
 *
 * <p>So `capabilityTitle` and `capabilityAsk` head and close the sentence `needsCapability`
 * already was, and `forbiddenBody` is now only about standing. The capability itself is drawn
 * as its own identifier — `VIEW_FINANCE` — for the reason `people-copy.ts` records: it is what
 * a member of staff asks an administrator for and what the service names back at them, so a
 * translated one would be a word nothing else in the system answers to.
 *
 * <h2>The 403s carry `{subject}`, and that is what unblocked `ConsoleRefusal`</h2>
 *
 * `apps/web/README.md` recorded `ConsoleRefusal` as the one component that could not be
 * translated on its own: its sentence names the thing a screen was about to show — "…to read
 * the audit trail" — and the noun belongs to the screen rather than to the component. That was
 * true while the screens were English literals and stopped being true the moment each of them
 * gained a catalogue node. Every screen now hands over its own `subject`, already translated
 * and already in whatever case its language needs, and the sentence is a template around it.
 *
 * <p>Which is also why `subject` is a whole noun phrase and never a stem with an article or a
 * suffix bolted on here. "the ledger" is `baş kitabı` in Azerbaijani and `defteri` in Turkish,
 * both of them already inflected for the position they sit in; a component that tried to build
 * that would be writing grammar for four languages in TypeScript.

 * What the console says when it names something — issue #402.
 *
 * <p>On the chrome rather than on each screen, because the alternative is nine copies of
 * the word "Copy" and nine chances for the eighth to be the one nobody translated. It is
 * the same argument the refusal table makes one field down, and the same one that put
 * `Save` in the root `common` namespace rather than in the console's.
 *
 * <p><strong>Nothing here names a kind of thing.</strong> "Copy" is a control, not a
 * sentence about accounts — the screen supplies the noun, exactly as it supplies
 * {@link ConsoleRefusalsCopy}'s `subject`, because "the campaign" is already inflected for
 * its position in the two languages that inflect it.
