/**
 * Every word the site shell draws, resolved on the server — issues #324 and #123.
 *
 * <h2>Why the copy is a prop and not a hook</h2>
 *
 * `SiteHeader`, `MobileNavDrawer` and `AccountMenu` are client components: they read the
 * session, they open a drawer, they close a menu on a click outside. The obvious way to give
 * them words is `useTranslations`, and that needs a `NextIntlClientProvider` above them —
 * which means above `SiteShell`, which is every route on the site.
 *
 * `apps/web/README.md` records what that costs, because this repository has measured it:
 * up to **27.4 KiB on every route in a group**, carried by routes that render none of the
 * copy. The catalogue is also not small and grows with each of these, and a provider
 * serialises the whole of it into the HTML for the client to parse.
 *
 * So the words are looked up here, once, on the server, and handed down as a plain object.
 * The client bundle gains the strings it actually renders and nothing else — no catalogue,
 * no provider, no `use-intl` runtime. `AccountArea` established the pattern for the account
 * rail; this is the same move for the shell, and it is the pattern the rest of the
 * application follows.
 *
 * <h2>One object rather than twenty props</h2>
 *
 * A flat prop list would put the whole shell's vocabulary in every component signature and
 * would have to be edited in four files each time a word is added. Grouping by the component
 * that draws it keeps each signature honest about what it needs.
