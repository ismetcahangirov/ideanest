/**
 * Every word the two collection surfaces draw — issue #324.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a prop and not a `getTranslations` inside each component</h2>
 *
 * `CollectionHeader`, `CollectionCard` and `CollectionIndex` are synchronous server components
 * with tests that render them directly, and Testing Library cannot render an async component —
 * `test-support/server-tree.ts` explains what that failure looks like when it happens. They
 * already took `locale` and `windowCopy` as props for exactly this reason since #123, and this
 * is the same arrangement widened to the rest of their vocabulary. `CollectionCampaigns` is a
 * client component and could not read the catalogue at all.
 *
 * <h2>Three counted sentences, and none of them can be ICU</h2>
 *
 * `count` is the collection's own total, drawn by a synchronous component; `shown` and
 * `shownMore` are drawn by a client component after a button appends a page. next-intl formats
 * ICU on the server inside an async call, so all three go through `lib/i18n/plurals.ts`
 * instead — which carries the same CLDR data and none of the runtime.
 *
 * <p>`shown` and `shownMore` are two sets rather than one plus a suffix. English appends ",
 * with more to load" and Russian changes the verb's agreement with the number in front of it,
 * so a suffix concatenated onto a formatted count is a sentence that is correct in exactly one
 * of the four languages.
