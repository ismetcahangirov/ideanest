/**
 * The one place in this application where a string is written twice, held level with the
 * catalogue by assertion — issue #324.
 *
 * `failure-copy.client.ts` explains why the duplication exists: the two error boundaries are
 * client components Next renders itself, so no server parent can hand them words, and the
 * provider that would let them look words up was measured at +24.7 KiB on **every** route.
 *
 * What follows is the price of that decision being safe. Without it the copy drifts silently:
 * somebody improves a phrase in `messages/ru.json`, the error page keeps the old one, and
 * nobody finds out because the page it appears on is the one nobody visits deliberately.
