/**
 * The language vocabulary, in one place — docs/architecture.md §21.1, issue #324.
 *
 * <h2>Why this file exists at all</h2>
 *
 * The service has been able to answer in four languages since V11, and this client has
 * never asked for one. `Taxonomy.SUPPORTED_LOCALES` on the API side and the check
 * constraint `users_locale_supported` in `V2__create_identity_schema.sql` both spell the
 * same four tags; this is the third spelling and the only one the browser can read. They
 * are kept in step by `locale.test.ts`, which asserts the list rather than trusting it,
 * because a fifth language added on one side and not the other is a 400 from a control
 * that looked like it worked.
 *
 * <h2>The tags are BCP 47 primary subtags and nothing more</h2>
 *
 * `az`, not `az-Latn-AZ`. The service resolves `Accept-Language` with RFC 4647 lookup, so
 * a region-tagged request already folds to the primary subtag on arrival, and carrying the
 * region here would mean storing a value the column's check constraint refuses.
 */

/**
 * §21.1's four, in the document's own order: the primary language first, then phase 1,
 * then phase 3. The order is what the preference screen lists them in, so it is data
 * rather than presentation — a screen that sorted them alphabetically would put Azerbaijani
 * first by accident and English second by accident, and the next language added would move
 * both.

 * WHAT AN UNSTATED PREFERENCE MEANS IN THIS CLIENT, AND WHY IT IS NOT `az`.
 *
 * §21.1 makes Azerbaijani the primary language and the service agrees — `users.locale`
 * defaults to `'az'` and `Taxonomy.PRIMARY_LOCALE` is `'az'`. This client deliberately
 * disagrees, and the disagreement is temporary and documented rather than accidental.
 *
 * The catalogue this constant is read beside covers the account area and nothing else yet.
 * Defaulting a visitor who has expressed no preference into Azerbaijani would hand them an
 * Azerbaijani navigation wrapped around English page bodies — a worse page than the
 * consistent English one they get today, and one they never asked for. A default is the
 * experience of everybody who never opens the preference screen, so it is the one value
 * that must not be aspirational.
 *
 * `en` therefore means "what this client can actually render end to end", and it moves to
 * `az` in the change that finishes the catalogue, not before. Nothing else in the codebase
 * needs to change when it does: every other file asks this constant.

 *
 * NOT `httpOnly`. The browser-side API client reads it to set `Accept-Language` on its own
