 * `next-intl/server`. That split is what lets a component test build the identical object out
 * of `messages/*.json` — asserting against the words the application will draw rather than
 * against words retyped into the test, which is a test that passes whatever the catalogue
 * says. Keeping the server call here means importing the shape never drags a server module
