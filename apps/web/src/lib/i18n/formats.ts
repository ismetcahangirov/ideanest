/**
 * What the platform's four language tags mean to `Intl` — issue #324, §21.1.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not the identity function</h2>
 *
 * `az`, `ru` and `tr` are handed to `Intl` unchanged, and English is not. A bare `en`
 * resolves to `en-US` inside every `Intl` constructor, which is a twelve-hour clock and a
 * month-first date — `Mar 14, 2026, 2:05 PM`. The other three languages this platform ships
 * all render `14 mar 2026, 14:05`, and so does the market it ships into.
 *
 * So the English reader of an Azerbaijani crowdfunding platform gets `en-GB`: the same clock
 * and the same field order as everybody else on the page, and the difference between the two
 * is invisible to anyone who is not looking for it. It was `'en-GB'` hard-coded in eight
 * modules before this file existed, which is where the decision actually was — the modules
 * simply had no way to say it for the other three languages.
 *
 * <h2>Region subtags stop here</h2>
 *
 * `lib/i18n/locale.ts` carries primary subtags and nothing else, because that is what the
 * service's RFC 4647 lookup folds to and what `users_locale_supported` will accept. This map
 * is the one place a region may appear, and it appears only where a formatter needs one.
 *
 * <h2>`az` is in this table and is not read from it — #401</h2>
 *
 * <p>Chromium claims `az` and formats it from root-locale data: `-3 w`, `2026 M08 14`, and a
 * twelve-hour clock on a page whose whole reason for existing is the opposite. Node does not,
 * so it is right on the server, right in every test, and wrong in front of the reader — and
 * `supportedLocalesOf` reports support, so no feature test can see it.
 *
 * <p>So the two constructors below send Azerbaijani to `lib/i18n/azerbaijani.ts` instead, on
 * every engine, and that file has the argument for why it is every engine rather than the
 * broken one. The entry stays because it is still what `az` means to `Intl` — the surrogate
 * that module renders its numbers with is `en-GB`, for the same reason English is.

/**
 * What a timestamp reads as when it cannot be parsed at all.
 *
 * <h2>Why one word lives here rather than in `messages/*.json`</h2>
 *
 * The formatters that print it — `lib/time.ts`, `lib/projects/deadline.ts` — are pure
 * functions called from client components that have no `NextIntlClientProvider` above them.
 * That absence is deliberate and measured: a provider in a shared layout added up to 27.4 KiB
 * to every route in its group, so copy is resolved on the server and handed down as props.
 * A formatter cannot be handed props.
 *
 * The alternative was to make every one of the seventy call sites pass a word in, for a
 * string that renders only when an instant the service sent will not parse — a defect path
 * that should never be reached. Four words in a checked-in table, tested against the same
 * catalogue rules, is the smaller thing to be wrong about.

 * Turkish. A dotless `i` upper-cases to `I` and a dotted one to `İ`, and the invariant
 * `toUpperCase` gets the second case wrong — `içinde` becomes `Içinde`, which is a different
 * word and reads to a Turkish speaker exactly as `Ínside` would to an English one. `Intl`'s
 * own relative-time output is lower case in all four languages, so anything that puts one of
