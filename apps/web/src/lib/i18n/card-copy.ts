/**
 * The words a campaign card draws, wherever it is drawn — issue #324.
 *
 * <h2>Why `common.card` exists as well as `discovery.card`</h2>
 *
 * This platform has two campaign cards. `components/discovery/ProjectCard` is the one the home
 * page, the feed, the search results, the category landings and the collections all render —
 * `CampaignGrid`'s docblock argues at length that a second card for the same JSON is a second
 * place for the money rules to be wrong. `components/profile/ProfileCampaignCard` is the other,
 * and it exists because §4.2's P-04 withholds amounts on a backed list, which is a rule about
 * what may be shown rather than about how to show it.
 *
 * Four of their sentences are word for word the same: the progress bar's accessible name, the
 * completion figure, the goal under it, and the backer count. Those live in `common.card` and
 * both read them. A second copy in each namespace would be two spellings of "of {amount} goal"
 * that agree until somebody edits one.
 *
 * `discovery.card` holds what is genuinely this card's own: the five status words, the deadline
 * and the creator's byline. `profile.card` holds the nine status words of an archive, which are
 * a different vocabulary for a different reader — `lib/i18n/profile-copy.ts` says why.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is a prop</h2>
 *
 * `ProjectCard` has no `'use client'` and is rendered both by `CampaignGrid`, which is a server
 * component, and by `DiscoveryView`, which is not. A component in both graphs cannot call
 * `getTranslations`; it is handed the words by whichever parent resolved them.
