/**
 * The words the campaign editor's frame draws — issue #324, docs/architecture.md §21.1.
 *
 * <h2>Why the copy arrives as a prop, like the checkout's</h2>
 *
 * Every panel under `components/campaign-editor` is a client component and has to be: the
 * form autosaves as it is typed, the story editor holds a document in state, the reward
 * editor opens a drawer. None of them can call `getTranslations`.
 *
 * `useTranslations` would need a `NextIntlClientProvider` above them, and `lib/i18n/shell-copy.ts`
 * carries what this repository measured that to cost — up to **27.4 KiB on every route in a
 * group**, paid by routes that draw none of the words. So each page under
 * `app/[locale]/projects/[id]/edit` resolves this on the server and hands it down, the same
 * move `checkout-copy.ts` makes for the same reason.
 *
 * <h2>This is the frame only, not the panels</h2>
 *
 * `EditorShell` and `SaveStatus` are drawn by every tab, so their words are resolved once and
 * threaded through each panel rather than repeated per tab. The panels' own copy — the field
 * labels, the hints, the refusals — belongs to the panel and follows in its own change.
 * Keeping them apart is what lets a tab be translated without touching the other five.
 *
 * <h2>The state vocabulary is the editor's own, and that is not an oversight</h2>
 *
 * `admin.screens.campaignDirectory.state` already names all sixteen states of §6.1, and this
 * deliberately does not reuse it. The two audiences are different: a moderator reading a queue
 * sees `SUBMITTED` as "awaiting review", and the creator whose campaign it is sees "in review".
 * The English the editor already drew is preserved key for key.
 *
 * **The two vocabularies have already drifted in English**, and this change does not silence
 * that: the console spells `CANCELED` "Cancelled" and the editor "Canceled". Which of the two
 * the product says is a copy decision rather than a translation one, so it is reported rather
 * than quietly resolved here.
