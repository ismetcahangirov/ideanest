/**
 * The breadcrumb steps a crawler reads, in each of the four languages — issue #123.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER:
 *
 *   - **the markup is in the language of the page it is on.** A `BreadcrumbList` is a claim
 *     about a document as it is presented, and until #123 all four languages emitted English
 *     constants — `Home → Categories` above a page whose own navigation read
 *     `Главная → Категории`. Structured data contradicting the visible page is the one kind a
 *     search engine has grounds to discount wholesale.
 *   - **the words come from the catalogue rather than from this test.** Every assertion below
 *     resolves through `messages/*.json`, so a translation changed there is a translation
 *     changed here, and one deleted there fails rather than being silently re-invented.
 *   - **the trail agrees with the navigation.** The footer already links "Categories" in four
 *     languages; a crumb that called it something else would be two names for one page.
