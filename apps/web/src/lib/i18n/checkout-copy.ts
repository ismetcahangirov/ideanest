/**
 * Every word the checkout draws — issue #324.
 *
 * <h2>Why the whole of it arrives as one prop</h2>
 *
 * All six components under `components/checkout` are client components, and they have to be:
 * the reservation clock ticks, the amount field validates as it is typed, the summary
 * recomputes on every choice. None of them can call `getTranslations`.
 *
 * `app/[locale]/projects/[id]/back/page.tsx` is a server component and is the single entry
 * point, so it resolves this object once and hands it to `CheckoutView`, which passes each
 * section down. `lib/i18n/shell-copy.ts` carries the measurement behind the pattern — a
 * `NextIntlClientProvider` was tried and cost +24.7 KiB on every route on the site.
 *
 * <h2>The checkout is the one surface where a translation is a money question</h2>
 *
 * "Nothing is charged unless the campaign reaches its goal" is not decoration; it is the
 * promise §5.1 makes and the single fact a first-time backer most often has wrong. A
 * translation that softened it, or that rendered a key name because somebody added a string
 * in English only, would be a page taking a financial commitment while failing to state its
 * terms. `errors` carries the same weight from the other side: a validation message that does
 * not appear leaves a form that refuses to submit and will not say why.
 *
 * That is why the shape is exhaustive and typed rather than an index signature. A missing
 * key is a compile error here, not a `settings.pages.x.y` on the screen where the money is.

 * error here, not a refusal that renders an empty alert on the screen where the money is.
