/**
 * Every word the two fulfilment screens draw — issue #324, §4.8 PM-07 and PM-08.
 *
 * <h2>Why the status words left `lib/fulfilment/describe.ts`</h2>
 *
 * That module paired each `FulfilmentStatus` with a label, a sentence and a `Tag` variant. The
 * variant is a design decision and stays — `RETURNED` is `--danger` because it is the one
 * status that asks the reader to act — and the two pieces of prose are copy. They are
 * `account.fulfilment.status` and `.statusDetail` now, keyed by the same status.
 *
 * A status this build does not know still shows the raw value with a sentence saying so.
 * `describeStatus` argued that showing the wire value is honest where a blank tag tells a
 * backer nothing and a guessed one tells them something wrong about where their parcel is;
 * that reasoning is unchanged and the fallback is the catalogue's now.
 *
 * <h2>Two sentences come in a pair each, and that is not duplication</h2>
 *
 * The locked notice and the saved confirmation each have a version with a timestamp and one
 * without, because the service does not always send the instant. English can append ", as of
 * …" to a finished sentence; Azerbaijani and Turkish put the clause before the verb, so a
 * suffix concatenated onto the end is a sentence that parses in one language of four.
