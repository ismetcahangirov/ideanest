/**
 * The one reader for `GET /v1/users/{slug}` and its lists — #323.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER:
 *
 *   - **nothing is invented for a field that is absent.** A biography that has not been
 *     written is `null`, not an empty string, so a tab omits the row rather than printing a
 *     box saying the creator has not written one. On a page whose subject is whether to send
 *     somebody money, an invented blank is worse than a missing row.
 *   - **an absent `joinedAt` stays absent.** This is the case the cast this module replaced
 *     could not survive: `new Date(null)` is January 1970, and a profile that printed it would
 *     be stating a fact about a stranger that nobody sent.
 *   - **money is never a number.** An amount arrives as a string and stays one, whatever a
 *     card does with it afterwards.
 *   - **a row with nothing to link to is dropped**, because it would render as an unlabelled
 *     hole in a list of somebody's work.
 *   - **a link that is not `https://` never reaches an anchor**, whatever the body said.
