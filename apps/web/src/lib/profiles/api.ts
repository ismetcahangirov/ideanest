 * §4.2's public profile — P-04, P-05, P-06 and P-07, issue #274.
 *
 * <h2>One module for four endpoints, because they are one page</h2>
 *
 * `GET /v1/users/{slug}`, its two lists, and the single write that decides whether any of
 * them answer at all. `lib/community/signals.ts` states the rule this follows — a screen's
 * data and its paginator belong together — and the alternative here is worse than usual: the
 * three reads share the 404 contract below, and a second module that read one of them would
 * be a second place for "private is indistinguishable from absent" to be got wrong.
 *
 * <h2>404 is the whole design, and the client must not decorate it</h2>
 *
 * The service answers **404** for an unknown slug, for a closed account, and for an account
 * whose `profile_visibility` is `PRIVATE`. Three different facts, one answer, deliberately:
 * a 403 would confirm that the person exists and has chosen to hide, which is precisely the
 * thing P-07 is for. So nothing in this module distinguishes them, nothing renders "this
 * profile is private", and the page renders the ordinary not-found route for all three.
 *
 * A client that tried to be helpful here — "that account is private" — would be an oracle
 * built on top of an endpoint designed not to be one, and it would leak the fact from the
 * browser rather than from the service, which is not an improvement.
 *
 * <h2>`publicFetch`, not `authorizedFetch`, for the reads</h2>
 *
 * All three are `permitAll` and a profile is what a signed-out visitor follows from a
 * campaign page. `authorizedFetch` throws when there is no token, which would turn "look at
 * who made this" into "sign in first". The one write is the caller's own account and takes
 * `authorizedFetch`.
 *
 * <h2>Money is on the created list and never on the backed one</h2>
 *
 * `ProfileProjectCard` carries `goal` and `pledged` because a creator's own campaigns are
 * public figures — the same numbers the discovery card shows. **P-04 says the backed archive
 * carries no amounts**, and the service omits them there rather than sending zeroes. Both
 * lists are the same type because they are the same rows from the same table; what differs
 * is what the service is willing to say about them, and `components/profile/ProfileCampaignCard`
 * is where that difference is enforced on screen. See its doc comment before "improving" it.

 * identifier is absent because nothing public is addressed by it — the slug is the address —
 * and `profile_visibility` is absent because a profile that answers at all is public by
 * definition, so a field saying so would carry no information and a field saying otherwise
 * could not exist.
 *
 * <h2>THERE ARE NO COUNTS ON THIS PROJECTION, AND THAT IS A BOUNDARY RATHER THAN AN OVERSIGHT</h2>
 *
 * "How many campaigns has this person created" is a question about `project`, and "how many
 * have they backed" is a question about `pledge`. Answering either from the `user` module —
 * the module every other module depends on — would make it depend on both in turn, which
 * `ModuleBoundaryTests` refuses outright. So the response carries none, and a client that
 * wants a number counts the rows it is already rendering.
 *
 * **Which means a client may only print a total it can actually know.** The lists are
 * paginated, so the length of a loaded page is a total exactly when there is no next cursor
 * and is a fraction otherwise. `components/profile/ProfileTabs` prints one under precisely
 * that condition and prints nothing the rest of the time; a figure that silently means "the
 * first twenty-four" is worse than no figure, because a reader has no way to tell which they
 * are looking at.
 *
 * <h2>Nulls are written out, deliberately</h2>
 *
 * Unlike most projections in this service, this one serialises `bio` and `avatarUrl` as
 * `null` rather than omitting them, so that "this person wrote no biography" and "the field I
 * expected is missing" are different things on the wire. They are typed as `T | null` and not
 * `?: T | null` for that reason: a caller that treated an absent key as "still loading" would
 * put a spinner over an answer it had already received.
 *
 * `socialLinks` goes the other way and is an **empty array, never null**, because an array is
 * a thing a client maps over — `PublicProfileResponse` says so in as many words.
 *
 * <h2>Eight fields since #276, and the three new ones are user-supplied addresses</h2>
 *
 * `websiteUrl` and every `socialLinks` address are strings a stranger typed into a form on a
 * page search engines index. The service refuses anything that is not `https://`, which
 * closes `javascript:` and `data:` outright — and closes nothing else.
 * `components/profile/ProfileAbout` carries the three `rel` tokens that close the rest, and
 * `OwnProfileResponse`'s Javadoc gives a different reason for each of them.

 * What visibility the account's own profile is currently set to — **read from its effect**.

 * <h2>Why this exists at all</h2>
 *
 * P-07's control is a write and there is no matching read: `GET /v1/me` carries six fields
 * and `profileVisibility` is not one of them. A switch that cannot show its own position is
 * not a switch, and the alternatives were both bad — guess `PUBLIC` because that is the
 * column default, which is a lie to everybody who has already turned it off; or offer two
 * buttons and no state, which asks somebody to make a decision the interface will not tell
 * them they have already made.
 *
 * So the setting is read from the thing it decides. `GET /v1/users/{slug}` answers 200 for a
 * public profile and 404 for a private one, and for the caller's own slug — an account that
 * is signed in, and therefore neither unknown nor closed — those are the only two answers
 * the contract allows. That makes the probe exact rather than a heuristic.
 *
 * <h2>It is deliberately anonymous, and that is the point rather than an economy</h2>
 *
 * A plain `fetch` rather than `publicFetch`, because `publicFetch` attaches the access token
 * when there is one and the question being asked is *what does a stranger see*. If the
 * service ever chose to show an owner their own hidden profile, a request carrying the
 * owner's token would answer 200 for a private account and the switch would read the
 * opposite of the truth. `credentials: 'omit'` makes the request unable to be recognised,
 * which is the only way to be sure the answer is the visitor's.
 *
 * `null` means neither — the service was unreachable, or answered something the contract
 * does not describe. The panel renders that as "not known" and refuses to move a switch it
 * cannot position, rather than picking a default and writing over somebody's choice.
