/**
 * `GET /v1/users/{slug}` and its two lists, narrowed once — issue #323.
 *
 * <h2>Why this module exists</h2>
 *
 * Two readers of the same endpoint were written in parallel during #321 and both merged:
 * `lib/profiles/server.ts`, which cast the body, and `lib/projects/creatorProfile.ts`, which
 * narrowed it field by field with a test. Both were correct and neither was the whole answer.
 * The cast is the half that is wrong — `lib/projects/publicPage.ts` sets out why at length —
 * and the field-by-field reader is the half that would have been lost by deleting the file
 * that looked like the duplicate. So the narrowing moved here, and both surfaces read through
 * it.
 *
 * <h2>What the cast actually cost</h2>
 *
 * Not a hypothetical. `PublicProfile.joinedAt` was typed `string` because the projection
 * always sends one, and `ProfileAbout` handed it straight to `new Date(...)`. A body without
 * the field — a service one release behind, a proxy that dropped it, a shape that was not the
 * JSON it claimed to be — puts `Invalid Date` on one profile and, for an explicit `null`,
 * **January 1970** on another. The second is the dangerous one: a confident sentence about a
 * stranger, assembled out of a field nobody sent. The type is `string | null` now, and this
 * module is what makes that true rather than merely declared.
 *
 * <h2>Every refusal is still one answer</h2>
 *
 * Nothing here inspects a status. The service answers 404 for an unknown slug, a closed
 * account and a `PRIVATE` one alike, so that a client cannot be used to tell them apart, and a
 * narrowing that reported *why* a body was unusable would rebuild that oracle one layer up. A
 * body this module cannot read is `null`, the same as a body that never arrived.
 *
 * <h2>Absent is not empty, and a dropped row is not a blank row</h2>
 *
 * A profile with no `slug` or no `name` is `null` rather than a profile with holes in it:
 * there is nothing to address it by and nothing to introduce it as. A campaign card missing
 * any of the five fields that make a link is dropped rather than rendered as an unlabelled
 * hole in somebody's body of work. Everything else stays optional, because "they have not
 * written a biography" and "the field did not arrive" both reach a reader as nothing, and only
 * one of them is worth a box on screen.
