/**
 * §5.5's update obligation, as the client reads it — issue #437, surfaced by #439.
 *
 * <h2>What this is, in one sentence</h2>
 *
 * A creator whose campaign funded owes their backers an update at least monthly until
 * fulfilment is complete, and §22.3 names the consequence: "the creator's project history
 * visible". This module is what makes that fact readable on a page.
 *
 * <h2>The state is the server's, and the client never recomputes it</h2>
 *
 * Every timestamp needed to derive the state is on the response, and the state is on it too.
 * That is deliberate: the boundary between `DUE_SOON` and `LAPSED` is a comparison against a
 * configured lead the browser does not know, and a second implementation of it in TypeScript
 * would disagree with the service on somebody's campaign page — the same argument
 * `CampaignOutcomeNotice` makes about recomputing §5.1 in the browser.
 *
 * The dates are still on the response, and are still rendered. They are what makes the state
 * checkable rather than asserted, and #437 asks for the fact "stated neutrally, with the date
 * of the last update".
 *
 * <h2>Narrowed, not cast — #323</h2>
 *
 * These reads go through a plain `fetch` against the same origin the generated client uses,
 * following `lib/profiles/server.ts`, so nothing here is type-checked by the compiler against
 * the service. The narrowing below is what stands in for that.
 */

/**
 * The five states, in the order they occur.
 *
 * `NEVER_UPDATED` is separate from `LAPSED` for the reason `FulfilmentProgress` separates
 * `untouched` from `preparing`: "has not posted since the campaign closed" and "posted, and
 * not recently" are the same to nobody reading the page to decide whether to back this creator
 * again. `COMPLETE` is separate from `CURRENT` for the mirror of that reason.
