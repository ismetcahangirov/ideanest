 * The narrowing behind §5.5's state — issue #437.
 *
 * <p>These reads go through a plain `fetch`, so nothing type-checks them against the service.
 * `#323`'s argument applies in full: the narrowing is the type check, and a test of the
 * narrowing is what stands in for a compiler.
 *
 * <p>Every case here is one that would otherwise put a wrong sentence on somebody's campaign
 * page rather than a crash in a log.
