 * Where a sign-in sends somebody afterwards — and why almost nothing is allowed to decide

 *
 * A GUARD THAT REDIRECTS TO A SIGN-IN HAS TO REMEMBER WHERE IT INTERRUPTED, or the price of
 * a fifteen-minute token expiring is that everybody lands on the home page and navigates
 * back by hand. It remembers it in the query string, which is the only place that survives
 * the full-page reload a sign-in performs.
 *
 * THAT MAKES IT ATTACKER-CONTROLLED, and an open redirect on a sign-in page is the classic
 * phishing primitive: a link to *our own* domain, with our own certificate and our own
 * padlock, that hands the reader to somebody else's login form the moment they have typed
 * their password into ours. So the value is never used as given.
 *
 * ONE FUNCTION, TWO CALLERS. The guard writes it and the sign-in page reads it. Splitting
 * "how it is written" from "how it is read" is how the two come to disagree about escaping,
 * and a redirect the reader half-decodes is a redirect that leaks a path segment.

 * Every one of these is refused, and each has been a real vulnerability somewhere:
 *
 *   - **An absolute URL.** `https://ideanest.example.com.evil.test/` is a different site
 *     that starts with our name, and the reader reads the first thing after `https://`.
 *   - **A protocol-relative URL.** `//evil.test/x` has no scheme, is not "absolute" to a
 *     naive check, and is resolved by every browser as `https://evil.test/x`.
 *   - **A backslash.** Browsers normalise `\` to `/` in a URL, so `/\evil.test` and
 *     `\/evil.test` are the protocol-relative case wearing a hat.
 *   - **A `javascript:` or `data:` value**, which a check for "starts with a slash" catches
 *     and a check for "is not http" does not.
 *   - **A control character**, including the tab, newline and carriage return that browsers
 *     strip from a URL before resolving it — so `/\tx//evil.test` is `//evil.test` by the
 *     time it is followed.
 *
 * What survives is a path, its query, and its fragment, all on this origin. The path is
 * rebuilt from a parse against a fixed dummy base rather than pattern-matched, because a
 * parser is what the browser will use and a regular expression is what somebody will find
 * one more case for.
