/**
 * The wire shape of §4.7's CD-16, narrowed once — issue #99.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER:
 *
 *   - **money stays a string.** Every amount arrives as a decimal string and is kept as one.
 *     CLAUDE.md §3: a JSON number is a double, and a double is where a pledge's last qapik
 *     goes.
 *   - **an absent figure is a zero with the campaign's currency**, at the campaign's number of
 *     decimals. A column of amounts where one is `0` and the rest are `0.00` reads as a
 *     rendering fault.
 *   - **an absent `reconciled` is not an unbalanced ledger.** Every field of the generated type
 *     is optional, because springdoc marks a record component required only when it can prove
 *     it — so "the service did not say" must not become a warning in front of a creator about
 *     nothing.
