/**
 * The countdown the dashboard draws, and the clock-skew correction it needs.
 *
 * <h2>Why the service sends two instants instead of a number</h2>
 *
 * `GET /v1/projects/{id}/dashboard` answers with `deadline` and `serverTime` and no
 * `secondsRemaining`. A remainder computed on the server is wrong the moment it is sent
 * and grows more wrong for as long as the page stays open — and the creator watching the
 * last hour of their campaign is exactly the reader who leaves it open.
 *
 * Two instants let this module do better than either side could alone. The difference
 * between `serverTime` and the browser's clock at the moment of the response is the
 * reader's skew; subtracting it makes every subsequent tick a countdown against the
 * service's clock rather than against a laptop that is forty minutes fast.
 *
 * <h2>Pure functions, and the reason they are not a hook</h2>
 *
 * Everything here takes the current time as an argument. A module that read `Date.now()`
 * internally would be one whose behaviour at the boundaries — the last minute, the moment
 * of expiry, a reader whose clock is a day out — could only be tested by waiting or by
 * mocking the global. These are the cases most worth testing and they are the ones that
 * arithmetic gets wrong.
