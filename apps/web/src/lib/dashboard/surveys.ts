 * What the survey builder asks the service — §4.8's PM-01 to PM-04, issue 73.

 * <h2>Browser reads, like the rest of the dashboard</h2>
 *
 * `lib/api/server.ts` sends no token by design, and every route here is one campaign
 * team's view of its own unsent questions behind a bearer token the service answers
 * `no-store`. There is nothing to render on the server, which is the argument
 * `lib/dashboard/backers.ts` already makes for the report.
 *
 * <h2>The types are the contract's, narrowed</h2>
 *
 * springdoc marks every field optional because Java cannot tell it otherwise. These
 * bodies are serialised with `JsonInclude.ALWAYS`, so the only genuinely absent fields
 * are the ones a draft has no answer for — `sentAt`, `sentTo` — and narrowing the rest
 * here is what keeps the screen free of `?.` on fields that cannot be missing.
