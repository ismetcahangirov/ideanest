/**
 * What the platform charges a creator to publish, and what one account holds.
 *
 * <h2>Money is a string here and stays one</h2>
 *
 * `"19.00"` and not `19`. §10.3 and CLAUDE.md: a JSON number is an IEEE 754 double in every
 * mainstream parser, and 19.90 is not representable in one. Nothing on the pricing page does
 * arithmetic with a price — it formats one — so the string travels intact to
 * `Intl.NumberFormat` and no `decimal.js` is needed. The moment something here adds two
 * prices together, it uses `decimal.js`, which is what CLAUDE.md requires of the frontend.
 *
 * <h2>`null` means "no limit", exactly as it does on the wire</h2>
 *
 * Not `0`, and not a large number. The service is deliberate about this and the client keeps
 * the convention rather than normalising it at the edge: a page that turned `null` into
 * `Infinity` would be one place away from rendering "up to Infinity campaigns".
 *
 * <h2>`entitled` is the field to branch on</h2>
 *
 * Not `state`. An `ACTIVE` subscription whose period ended an hour ago entitles nobody, and
 * the service computes the pair for exactly that reason. A page deriving it from `state` and
 * `currentPeriodEnd` would get the boundary wrong once, on a page about money.
