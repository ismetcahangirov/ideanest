 * configuration lives, so that `getTranslations` on the server and
 * `NextIntlClientProvider` in the browser resolve to the same catalogue without
 * every route passing one down by hand.
 *
 * IT IS POINTED AT A PATH RATHER THAN LEFT TO THE DEFAULT because the default
 * looks for `./i18n/request.ts` at the application root, and everything in this
 * application that is not a route lives under `src/`. A convention that puts one
 * module somewhere none of its neighbours are is a module nobody finds.
 *
 * THE LANGUAGE IS A PATH SEGMENT (#123). `src/i18n/routing.ts` declares the
 * shape, `src/middleware.ts` sends a bare path to a prefixed one, and
 * `src/i18n/request.ts` resolves the catalogue from the matched `[locale]`
 * parameter. Nothing here reads a cookie, so a localised page is as static as
 * the English one it replaced.

   * no browser will display. `src/lib/images/source.ts` keeps the same rule on
   * the render side, because an address `next/image` cannot match throws, and a
   * throw in a server component takes the route down with it.
   *
   * THE WILDCARD HOSTNAME IS DELIBERATE AND IT IS A KNOWN COST. There is no
   * uploader and no object storage yet (docs/architecture.md §13.1, contract
   * §3): a cover is an address a creator typed, on a host nobody can enumerate
   * in advance. An allowlist today is an allowlist that matches nothing, and
   * then no cover on the platform is ever converted to AVIF — the whole point
   * of this file. What it costs is that `/_next/image` will fetch and re-encode
   * any HTTPS URL handed to it, so it can be used as an image proxy by anybody
   * who can write the query string. Next refuses private and loopback addresses
   * on its own, so the exposure is bandwidth rather than a route into the
   * network.
   *
   * THE FIX IS THE MEDIA PIPELINE, NOT A LONGER PATTERN LIST. Once §13.1's
   * storage exists every cover is on one origin, this narrows to that origin,
   * and the proxy stops existing. It is written into §13.1 as part of that
   * work rather than left here as a comment nobody is accountable for.
