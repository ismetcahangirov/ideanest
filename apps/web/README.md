# @ideanest/web

The Next.js application. App Router, React 19, Tailwind 4, and the primitives
from `@ideanest/ui`.

`@ideanest/ui` has two entry points and the choice is a performance decision, not
a taste one: the root is free, and `@ideanest/ui/motion` pulls in 116 kB of
animation runtime. Import `FadeUp`, `Modal`, `Drawer`, `Popover`, `Tooltip` and
the toast pair from `/motion`; import everything else from the root. A route that
never imports `/motion` never ships `motion` — which is how the checkout stopped
paying for an animation library it does not use. `packages/ui/README.md` has the
measurement.

## Running it

```bash
pnpm --filter @ideanest/web dev        # http://localhost:3000
```

The service has to be running too, because every `/v1` request is proxied to it:

```bash
cd apps/api && ./gradlew bootRun       # http://localhost:8080
```

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `IDEANEST_API_ORIGIN` | `http://localhost:8080` | Where `/v1/*` is proxied. Read at build time on the server only — the browser never learns it. The sitemap also reads the service directly through it |
| `IDEANEST_SITE_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` | This application's public origin. **Must be set in any deployed environment** — every `robots.txt` entry, sitemap URL, canonical URL, `og:url`, and absolute social-image URL is written against it. Server-only, and read at build time by the statically rendered pages, so changing it means rebuilding. A value that is set but is not an absolute `http(s)` URL is refused rather than fallen back on |
| `IDEANEST_REVALIDATE_SECRET` | unset | The shared secret the service presents to `POST /api/cache/revalidate`. **Unset refuses every call**, rather than allowing them: an endpoint that evicts cached pages by name and asks for no proof is a request anybody can send in a loop to turn every cached render into an origin fetch. Same value as the service's `CACHE_REVALIDATE_SECRET`. See [Caching and revalidation](#caching-and-revalidation) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_IDEANEST_RUM_SAMPLE_RATE` | `1` | Fraction of sessions whose Core Web Vitals are reported. `0` collects nothing at all. `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, so it is inlined at build time and changing it means rebuilding. See [Real user monitoring](#real-user-monitoring) |
| `IDEANEST_RUM_LOCAL_SINK` | on outside production | The in-memory buffer behind `GET /api/rum`. `next start` runs as production on a laptop too, so set `true` to keep the table there |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | unset | Google's OAuth client identifier (§4.1 A-04). **Unset means the Google button is not rendered at all** — the service answers 501 for a provider it has no configuration for, and a button that always fails is worst of all on the sign-in screen. A client identifier is public by construction; the client *secret* is the service's and neither of these flows uses one |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLE_CLIENT_ID` | unset | Apple's services identifier (§4.1 A-05), on the same terms. The popup flow still needs a redirect URI registered with Apple; this application sends its own `/sign-in` |

### Why the API is proxied rather than called directly

The refresh cookie is `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, scoped to `/v1/auth`. A
browser will not attach it to a request aimed at a different origin, which is
the entire point of the setting, and the service declares no CORS policy so a
cross-origin call would not survive its preflight either. Routing `/v1` through
this application is what makes the pair same-origin, and therefore what makes
the browser half of the auth flow work at all.

### The three shells, which routes carry them, and how

The **Shell** column is what §4.13 WS-01 and WS-02 describe. Three values:

| Value | What it is | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Site** | Global header, collapsing navigation, search, footer | `app/(site)/layout.tsx` → `SiteShell` |
| **Minimal** | A wordmark that goes home, and a one-line footer | `MinimalShell`, used by `app/(auth)` and by the root failure states |
| **Console** | A bar with a way back to the site, and a rail over the console's screens | `app/admin/layout.tsx` → `AdminArea` (#294) |
| **—** | No shared chrome. The page draws its own | — |

**A route does not have to live in `app/(site)` to carry the site shell.**
Several do not, and each renders `SiteShell` from a four-line layout at its own
segment: `/u/{slug}` (`app/u/layout.tsx`, #274), `/notifications` (#345),
`/projects/[id]/[projectSlug]` and `/projects/[id]/prelaunch` (#343), and
`/projects/new` and the six editor tabs (#347). Everything under
`/projects/[id]` is there of necessity: that segment also carries `/back`, and
Next allows one slug name per level, so lifting the public half into the group
would mean restructuring the private half with it. A leaf layout buys the same
chrome and leaves the siblings alone.

That is not only a convenience. It means chrome is opt-in per segment rather
than opt-out, which is what keeps the next bullet true by default instead of by
exception:

- `/projects/[id]/back` should **not** get the site header. `docs/ui-kit.md`
  §8.5 makes the checkout the one screen a white panel dominates and
  `docs/motion-system.md` §5 gives it a motion budget of near zero; a collapsing
  navigation bar offering a trip to Discover, on the screen where somebody is
  about to pledge, is the opposite of both.
- The `/admin` routes have their own shell since #294 — **Console** above. It is deliberately
  not `SiteShell`: the public header offers Discover, the categories, search and "Start a
  project", none of which a member of staff clearing a report queue wants, and `MinimalShell`
  records what importing that header costs a route which draws no navigation.

**The campaign page and the pre-launch page moved into it with #343**, and each
gave up a `<main>` of its own in the move, for the same reason the account
screens did below: `SiteShell` owns the only one on the page.

**The campaign editor and `/projects/new` joined the site shell with #347.** All
six editor tabs and the create form take `SiteShell` from a layout at their own
segment. `docs/motion-system.md` §5 gives the editor "None — autosave indicator
only" and gives the shell "One — §4.7's collapse"; those coexist because the same
table charges the collapse to the shell's own row, "paid on all of them at once",
rather than to the surface under it. `EditorShell`'s campaign title moved from a
`<header>` to a `<div>` in the same change, so the page announces one banner and
not two, and the six tabs each gave up a `<main>`.

**The account area moved into the site shell with #275.** `/settings/*`, `/account/*` and
`/pledges/*` share `AccountArea` — the site header and footer, plus a navigation over the
eight screens somebody manages about themselves. The authentication screens keep the minimal
shell for the opposite reason: a sign-in page is a screen with one job, and somebody already
signed in and changing a notification setting is not mid-transaction. `/settings/sessions` and
`/settings/notifications` each lost a `<main>` of their own in the move, because `SiteShell`
owns the only one on the page.

**`/notifications` joined the site shell with #345, and took `SiteShell` rather
than `AccountArea`.** It is the route the header's own bell links to, so a frame
that vanished on arrival read as having left the site. It is deliberately not an
account screen — its docblock argues that "this is not a setting, it is a place
somebody reads" — and it is not in `ACCOUNT_GROUPS`, so the account rail would
have drawn thirteen entries with none of them marked `aria-current="page"`. It
gave up a `<main>` of its own for the same reason the two screens above did.

**Every route is served under a `[locale]` segment (#123).** `/az/discover`, `/ru/discover`
and so on; `middleware.ts` answers a bare path with a 307 to the language the reader last
chose. `src/i18n/routing.ts` declares the shape, `src/i18n/request.ts` resolves the catalogue
from the matched segment, and `src/i18n/navigation.tsx` is what every `Link`, `useRouter` and
`usePathname` in the application must come from — a raw `next/link` drops the language and
sends the reader through the redirect, which reads to them as the site forgetting what they
picked.

**Which routes are key-based, and which are still English literals (#324).** The message
catalogue lives in `messages/{az,en,ru,tr}.json` and covers **the site shell and every
signed-in screen's frame**: the header, the mobile drawer, the account menu, the footer, the
skip link, the shared failure links, `AccountArea` and its navigation, and the tab title,
heading and introduction of all thirteen screens under `/settings/*`, `/account/*`,
`/pledges` and `/notifications`. What is still English is the **panels below those headings**
— the forms, tables and empty states each screen renders — along with the whole public site,
the checkout, the campaign editor and the console.

**Two suites hold the catalogue honest, and they cover different halves.**
`lib/i18n/catalogue.test.ts` asserts properties of the messages: that the four languages hold
the same keys, that none is empty, that every rich-text tag is balanced and matches English,
and that no Latin-script language contains a Cyrillic homoglyph — а, е, о, р, с, х and у are
drawn identically to their Latin counterparts, so one pasted into an Azerbaijani string reads
as correct to every reviewer while breaking search and switching a screen reader's voice
mid-word. One was found in `account.pages.surveys.intro` this way.
`app/[locale]/account-area.pages.test.ts` asserts the other half — that each page actually
*asks* for its keys, since a screen rewritten with a literal back in it passes every catalogue
check while showing English to everybody.

**How a word reaches a component, and the measurement behind it.** Server components call
`getTranslations`. Client components are handed a resolved object as a prop by their server
parent — `SiteShell` calls `shellCopy()` once and passes it to `SiteHeader`,
`MobileNavDrawer` and `AccountMenu`. They are **not** given `useTranslations`, because that
needs a `NextIntlClientProvider`, and a provider in `app/[locale]/layout.tsx` carrying only
the `shell` namespace was measured at **+24.7 KiB on every route** — `/[locale]/about` went
from 571.3 KiB of First Load JS to 596.0 KiB and six authentication routes broke their
budgets. Without it the same page is 556.8 KiB.

`src/lib/i18n/shell-copy.ts` holds the types and the pure builders and imports nothing from
`next-intl/server`; `shell-copy.server.ts` is the half that reads the request. The split is
what lets a component test build the same object out of `messages/*.json`, so the assertions
are against the words the application draws rather than words retyped into a test.

**The one exception, and it is measured rather than assumed.** `app/[locale]/error.tsx` and
`app/[locale]/(site)/error.tsx` are error boundaries, which Next requires to be client
components and renders itself — no server parent can hand them anything.
`src/lib/i18n/failure-copy.client.ts` carries their eight strings in all four languages, under
a kilobyte, and `failure-copy.client.test.ts` asserts every one of them against the catalogue
so the two cannot drift. A third such surface should re-measure the provider rather than
extend that file.

That is now the whole of the remaining work, and it is no longer blocked on anything. Until
#123 there was a real argument for leaving the public half alone — see below — and it does
not survive the language moving into the path.

**The console is in scope now, and #294's exemption is withdrawn.** That issue argued that
§21.1's catalogue exists for the product's readers while the console's readers are the people
who operate the platform, so sixteen module descriptions in four languages was four times the
strings to keep current for nobody. The decision has been reversed deliberately rather than
forgotten: the platform is to be legible in all four languages to everyone who uses it, staff
included. `lib/admin/navigation.ts` carries the old note and is updated with the keys.

**What the split used to be, and why it is gone.** The catalogue was reached through a
cookie, and reading a cookie makes a render dynamic. The account area is authenticated and
renders per person already, so it paid nothing; `/`, the category landings and the static
pages are cached shared renders that a per-visitor language would have turned into a render
each, on the largest contentful paint of the pages a stranger meets first. So the public half
stayed in English for a performance reason rather than a scheduling one.

A path segment removes the trade rather than improving it. `/az/discover` and `/ru/discover`
are different URLs, so each is a cached render of its own and neither has to ask who is
asking — the build output prints four `●` prerenders per static route where it printed one.
`app/[locale]/layout.tsx` declares the segment as the document's `lang`, so `AccountArea` no
longer needs its `<div lang>` override, and `SITE_LANGUAGE` survives only in
`app/global-error.tsx`, which replaces the document after the layout that would have known
the language failed. `docs/architecture.md` §21.1 carries the full argument.

**There is no route for the two-factor challenge (#272).** It is a state of the sign-in form.
The challenge `POST /v1/auth/login` returns is a credential for the next few minutes — the
service marks the response `no-store` — and a URL is where a credential must not go: query
strings are written to access logs, kept in history, and forwarded in the `Referer` header of
whatever loads next. `TwoFactorChallenge` carries the full argument.

**The console is thirteen routes and nine of §4.11's sixteen modules, and `/admin` says
which.** #259's definition of done is that every module has either a screen or an open
blocker naming what it waits on, so the console's front door lists all sixteen: the nine that
work link to their screens, and the seven that do not say what they are blocked on and which
issue owns it. `lib/admin/navigation.ts` is the single list behind both that page and the
rail, and `navigation.test.ts` asserts the two cannot disagree — a rail entry belonging to no
module, or a screen in no rail, fails the suite.

**None of those routes is a gate, and none of them may become one.** There is no role model
in the schema or in the access token, so every endpoint the console calls refuses a caller
who is not on the configured moderator list and each screen renders that refusal. A check in
a layout would be a second, weaker copy of one the service already makes correctly, and the
dangerous direction is the one where the browser says yes. #295 is the issue that replaces
the list with something a client could honestly read.

**`/maintenance` has no switch in front of it.** It is a page an edge or a load
balancer can be pointed at during a planned outage, and nothing in this
application redirects to it. Whatever performs the switch is a deployment
concern and belongs with #139's environments work; the honest scope of #263 was
to ship the page.

**Two failure states, two frames.** `app/not-found.tsx` and `app/error.tsx` sit
at the root of the route tree, because Next serves them for a request that
matched nothing and for a throw anywhere — and a root file's client components
land in **every** route's first load. Rendering the full site header there cost
83.3 KiB on the checkout, on every editor tab and on the admin console, none of
which use it; `apps/web/performance/README.md` records the measurement. So the
root pair uses `MinimalShell`, and `app/(site)/not-found.tsx` and
`app/(site)/error.tsx` render the same failure state inside the full shell,
where it is already paid for.

**The first segment of the campaign page is a creator's slug, and the folder is
called `[id]` anyway.** Next allows exactly one slug name per dynamic level, and
`app/projects/[id]/` already carries the creator's own routes, where the segment
really is a campaign identifier; a sibling `[creatorSlug]` is a build error. The
URL is correct and the folder name is a framework artefact — see the page's own
comment. Renaming it belongs with whatever moves the creator's routes out from
under `/projects`.

Every route above declares its metadata through `src/lib/seo/metadata.ts` — see
[Metadata and social previews](#metadata-and-social-previews).

## The session, and where it is read

`SessionProvider` is mounted on the **root** layout and bootstraps once per page
load: it spends the `HttpOnly` refresh cookie against `POST /v1/auth/refresh`,
holds the fifteen-minute access token in a module variable, and reads
`GET /v1/me`. Everything under it — the header, the drawer, and the route guard
— asks that one provider rather than fetching for itself.

**Issue #267 asked for the session to be read on the server, and it cannot be
read there.** The refresh cookie is issued on `Path=/v1/auth`
(`ideanest.auth.refresh-cookie.path` in `apps/api`), and a browser sends a
cookie only to paths under its own — so a request for `/`, or for any page in
this application, carries nothing for `cookies()` to read. There is no session
on the server to expose, whatever this application does.

That scope is not an accident to route around: `AuthProperties.RefreshCookie`
narrows it deliberately, so a thirty-day credential is not attached to every
request to the API. Widening it is a change to the service and belongs to
whoever owns §17, not to an epic whose stated scope is "the web client only".
**What it costs today** is one round trip after hydration before the header
knows who is reading, which is why the header renders a neutral placeholder
rather than guessing. #267 is left open for the server half.

The guard lives in the same provider, so no private route has to remember to
guard itself. `src/lib/session/private-routes.ts` is the list it uses, and it is
deliberately **not** `PRIVATE_PATH_PREFIXES` from the SEO module — "must not be
indexed" and "requires a session" are different questions, and the pre-launch
page and the checkout are in one list and not the other.

Every public route in the site shell — `/`, `/discover`, `/search`, `/categories`
and its landing pages, `/u/{slug}`, the campaign page and
`/projects/[id]/prelaunch` — works with no session at all, and so do the three
authentication screens. `/projects/[id]/back` is the half-way case: its reward list is
`permitAll` and reads through `publicFetch`, so the prices render for a visitor
who has not registered, and only the two mutations need a session. For the pre-launch page the reason is the followers it exists to
collect, who have not registered; for discovery it is that a visitor who has not
registered is the entire audience — requiring a token would mean the front door
could not render. Both read through `publicFetch`, which sends a bearer token
only when one is already in memory and never fetches one.

## The verification link

`POST /v1/auth/register` issues a token and the service sends the message that
carries it (`RegistrationService` publishes `EmailVerificationRequested`). The
link in that message resolves against
`ideanest.notification.email.base-url`, which is this application's origin, and
it must point at:

```
{WEB_BASE_URL}/verify-email?token={token}
```

That path and that parameter name are the whole contract between the two halves,
which is why they are written down here as well as in the page's own comment.
The page reads the token out of its own URL and sends it in a **body** —
`VerifyEmailRequest` gives the reason: a query string is written to access logs,
kept in browser history, and forwarded in the `Referer` header of whatever the
page loads next, and this value is a credential until it is spent.

**There is no resend.** `RegistrationService` answers a second registration for
an existing address by publishing `RegistrationAttemptedOnExistingAccount` and
returning, and it issues no new token. So the expired-link page offers no resend
button that would do nothing, and says what does work instead — signing in,
which `SignInService` deliberately allows before an address is verified. The
account menu carries the unverified state from there.

### The other two links, on the same contract

#271 and #277 added two more messages with a token in a URL, and neither the API
nor a mail transport builds those URLs yet (#86), so this file is where they are
written down. Both resolve against the same
`ideanest.notification.email.base-url` and both must point at:

```
{WEB_BASE_URL}/reset-password/confirm?token={token}      # A-06, one hour
{WEB_BASE_URL}/confirm-email-change?token={token}        # A-12, six hours
```

Each page reads the token out of its own URL and sends it in a **body**, for the
reason above and one stronger: spending the first sets a password, and spending
the second moves the address a password reset is sent to. `ResetPasswordRequest`
and `ConfirmEmailChangeRequest` both restate the argument.

**Unlike verification, the reset link has a resend and the address change does
not.** `/reset-password` can be asked again by anybody — it answers 202 either
way, so offering it costs nothing and discloses nothing, and asking again retires
the previous link. The address change cannot: asking again requires the current
password and a session, so a dead confirmation link sends the reader back to
`/settings/email` rather than offering a button that would 401.

**`weak-password` on the reset does not withdraw the form.** The service checks
the password policy before it claims the link, so the token survives a rejected
password and the page keeps both. That is the one refusal on either screen that
leaves the form usable, and it exists because the alternative — burning a
single-use, one-hour link on a typo — is this flow's most common support ticket.


## Server rendering

`docs/architecture.md` §4.4 and issue #119. The requirement is not "renders on
the server" — every route here already did — but that **the content is in the
initial HTML rather than assembled by the client**. Two routes were failing it,
in different ways.

| Route | Before | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `/projects/[id]/[projectSlug]` | Did not exist. Every campaign link in discovery pointed at a 404 | A Server Component with no `'use client'` beneath it. Title, summary, creator, funding figures, story, risks and reward tiers are all in the first response |
| `/discover` | Shipped an empty grid and fetched page one from the browser | The first page is fetched on the server for whatever filters the URL names, and handed to the view |

### How the two reads work

`src/lib/api/server.ts` is the server-side counterpart of `lib/api/client.ts`,
and the split is not cosmetic. The client module issues a **relative** `/v1`
request, which is same-origin in a browser because `next.config.mjs` rewrites it
— the only arrangement in which a `SameSite=Strict` refresh cookie travels — and
which throws `Failed to parse URL` in a Server Component, where there is no
document, no origin, and no rewrite. Server reads therefore resolve against
`IDEANEST_API_ORIGIN` directly, exactly as the sitemap already did.

Everything there is **anonymous**, and that is a decision. A server render that
varied by session could not be cached by anything, shared by anybody, or served
to the crawler the work exists for. A signed-in visitor's personal additions —
whether they have saved a campaign, whether they have backed it — belong to a
client component that fetches them after hydration, because those are the parts
that must not be in a shared cache.

**A refused read is `null` and never a thrown page.** The campaign page turns
`null` into a 404; discovery passes nothing and the view fetches page one itself,
which is exactly what it did before. A visitor whose first request lands during a
restart sees the skeleton and then the feed rather than an error. A *bug* —
a malformed base URL, say — is allowed to surface, because swallowing it would
turn a misconfigured deployment into a site where every campaign has quietly
stopped existing.

### What is deliberately not server-rendered

The creator dashboard (#93). It is one creator's view of their own money behind
a bearer token, and the service answers it `no-store` — none of the three
reasons above applies to it. `lib/api/server.ts` sends no token by design, so
there is nothing for a Server Component to read, and a render that varied by
session is exactly what that module refuses to do. The panel fetches after
hydration, like the moderation queue, and its loading state is honest: those
figures move while you are looking at them.

Reading this table as "server rendering is better" would be the wrong lesson.
The rule is that content a stranger and a crawler need belongs in the first
byte; content only one signed-in person may see does not, and putting it there
costs the cacheability that made the rule worth having.

### The one client component beneath the campaign page (#91)

`LiveFunding` is §12.1's counter, and it is the exception that proves the rule
above rather than a hole in it. **Every number it renders is in the initial
HTML**, from the server's read — a crawler, a link unfurler and a reader with no
JavaScript see the campaign's real totals. What hydration adds is arithmetic on
top of them: the socket carries "40.50 arrived since I last spoke", never a
total, so the component starts from the server's figure and adds each delta. A
client component that *fetched* these numbers would break #119; one that starts
from them does not.

**It is opt-in and unset by default.** `next.config.mjs` says the browser never
learns the API's real origin — it talks to this application, and `/v1` is
rewritten server-side — and a WebSocket cannot use that rewrite, because Next
does not proxy an upgrade. So `IDEANEST_REALTIME_ORIGIN` is absent unless a
deployment has somewhere to point it, and with nothing configured this page
behaves exactly as it did before. The API's `ideanest.realtime.allowed-origins`
is the compensating control on the other side; a handshake is not subject to
CORS, so the origin check has to be the server's own.

**What it cost, and what that teaches about client components here.** The route
went 60 KiB over its First Load JS budget, which is now 580 rather than 492.
Two thirds of the original overage was avoidable and was avoided: a client
component pulls its **whole import graph** into the browser bundle, so
`@ideanest/ui` became `@ideanest/ui/server` — the lean entry is the right one
from a client component too — and `completionOf` moved out of `publicPage.ts`
into `lib/projects/completion.ts`, a leaf whose only dependency is `decimal.js`.
What remains is `decimal.js` itself, which is not negotiable: CLAUDE.md forbids
floating point for money, and this is the one place on the platform where an
amount is accumulated repeatedly in a browser.

**The backer count is deliberately not live.** A window carries how many pledges
were confirmed, and a pledge is not always a new backer — somebody raising their
pledge confirms again. Adding it would make the count drift upwards over a
campaign's life with no way to correct itself, which is worse than a count that
is right at page load.

### The seeded feed

`useDiscoveryFeed` takes an optional first page carrying the filter key it was
fetched for. It is adopted only while it answers the question being asked, so a
page fetched for `?status=live` is never shown under `?category=games`; when the
key matches, the browser does not request page one again. Changing a filter is
`router.push` to the same route with a different query, which re-runs the Server
Component and produces a fresh seed for the new key.

**`/discover` is dynamic rather than static as a result.** That is the direct
cost of rendering a filtered feed on the server, and it is the trade #119 asks
for: a static page with an empty grid has nothing in its HTML. The single
canonical URL is unaffected and stands on its own argument — the filters select a
subset of one corpus, and indexing every combination would spend the whole site's
crawl budget on permutations of one list.

### Typed against the published contract

Both reads go through `@ideanest/api-client`, generated from
`apps/api/openapi.json`. Every property on a generated response type is optional
— springdoc marks a field required only when it can prove it — so
`src/lib/projects/publicPage.ts` narrows once, in one place, and answers `null`
for a response that is not a campaign rather than letting a component print
`undefined` into somebody's page.

### `@ideanest/ui/server`

A Server Component may not import the root barrel: several of its members consume
`createContext`, and `next build` refuses the route outright, naming a component
the page never used. The stateless members are re-exported from
`@ideanest/ui/server`, and `packages/ui/src/server.test.ts` walks everything
reachable from it and fails if any of it acquires a hook. The rule used to be a
comment in `app/discover/page.tsx` asking people not to; it is now a boundary.

## Caching and revalidation

`docs/architecture.md` §4.13 and issue #127. Three layers, and each answers a
question the one above it cannot.

### The data cache, and why sixty seconds is not enough on its own

Every public read carries `next: { revalidate: 60 }`, matching the
`Cache-Control` the service puts on the same read. That bounds load and it does
not bound *wrongness*: a backer who pledges watches the total they just moved sit
unchanged for up to a minute on the one page where the number is the point, and a
creator who publishes an update sends people to a page that does not have it yet.

Shortening the window is the wrong fix. It costs every reader of every campaign a
request to make the one campaign that changed correct sooner, and it still does
not make it correct *now*.

So every public read is also tagged. `src/lib/cache/tags.ts` holds the
vocabulary — the campaign by address and by identifier, the taxonomy, the
collections, one profile — and the service names the campaign that changed.

**A pledge deliberately does not invalidate the discovery feed.** A pledge
changes the amount raised, which changes the ordering of a feed sorted by
momentum, so on paper every pledge on the platform invalidates every feed page.
That is a cache which is empty at any interesting traffic level, bought with a
reader seeing a slightly older ordering of campaigns they have not chosen yet.
The feed keeps its minute, and `discovery` is evicted only by the events that
change what is *in* it — a launch, and the two ways a campaign ends.

### `POST /api/cache/revalidate`

Authenticated with a shared secret in `IDEANEST_REVALIDATE_SECRET`, compared in
constant time. **With no secret configured it refuses everything**, rather than
allowing everything: a deployment that lost the variable would otherwise come up
with the door open and nothing would say so.

The secret is not protecting confidential data — the tags name public pages — it
is protecting the cache. An endpoint that evicts by name and asks for no proof is
a request anybody can send in a loop to turn every cached render into an origin
fetch, which is a denial-of-service against the service the cache exists to
shield.

The tag vocabulary is closed and an unrecognised tag is **named in the response**
rather than ignored, because a caller whose tag was silently dropped would
believe the page had been refreshed and would go looking for the fault on the
wrong side. The realistic threat is a caller with the secret and a bug: an empty
string, or a wildcard, both of which would evict everything.

The far side is `az.ideanest.shared.cache` in `apps/api`, which is configured
with `CACHE_REVALIDATE_URL` and `CACHE_REVALIDATE_SECRET`. Everything it does is
a hint: it never throws, it never blocks the outbox relay that feeds it, and it
drops rather than queues when the web client is unreachable. A hint that is lost
costs a page that is briefly stale, which is what the window above already
guarantees.

### `Cache-Control` for a shared cache

`src/lib/cache/publicRoutes.ts`, applied in `middleware.ts`. Public pages are
served `public, s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=600`; everything else keeps
the framework's `private, no-store`.

This is safe because **every server render in this application is anonymous**,
and that is a property rather than a coincidence: the refresh cookie is issued on
`Path=/v1/auth`, so a page request carries no session, and nothing under `src/`
calls `next/headers` at all. A signed-in reader and a stranger are served the
same HTML and the difference appears after hydration.

It is an allow-list of path shapes rather than a deny-list, and it is a function
rather than a `headers()` entry in `next.config.mjs`, because the campaign's
public page is `/{locale}/projects/{id}/{projectSlug}` and the creator's editor is
`/{locale}/projects/{id}/edit`. A path pattern that matches the first matches the
second, and the shape of that mistake — a creator's draft marked publicly
cacheable — is invisible in review and obvious in production.

## Metadata and social previews

Every title, description, canonical URL, and social card is built by
`src/lib/seo/metadata.ts` (#120). No page writes an `openGraph` block of its own:
a page that did would be the page that forgot `og:site_name`, or spelled the
locale differently, or printed the site name into `og:title` where
`og:site_name` already says it — mistakes that render identically in review and
are visible in every shared link forever.

| Module | Holds |
|---|---|
| `lib/seo/metadata.ts` | `publicPageMetadata`, `privatePageMetadata`, `projectPageMetadata`, the canonical rule, word-boundary truncation, and the §6.1 public/private split |
| `lib/seo/metadata-source.ts` | The one server-side, **anonymous** read of a campaign's public projection |
| `lib/seo/metadata-card.tsx` | The Open Graph card, drawn from `@ideanest/design-tokens` |
| `app/opengraph-image.tsx` | The site's card. Static — rendered once by `next build` |
| `app/discover/opengraph-image.tsx` | The same card for `/discover`, and it is **not** redundant (see below) |
| `app/projects/[id]/prelaunch/opengraph-image.tsx` | A campaign's card, per request |

**Two shapes, because there are two kinds of page.** A public page gets a
canonical, a full Open Graph block, and a large X card. A private one —
`/projects/[id]/back`, `/projects/new`, `/settings/sessions`, `/notifications`,
`/settings/notifications`, every editor tab —
gets `noindex, nofollow`, no canonical, and no card at all. `nofollow` as well as
`noindex` on all of them: they are shells around client boundaries, so the markup
a crawler receives has no links in it, and `follow` would be a promise of crawl
budget spent finding nothing.

**One canonical for the whole of discovery, and every query string is dropped.**
The filters live in the query string and the feed they select is fetched in the
browser, so `/discover`, `/discover?category=games`, and
`/discover?utm_source=news&page=7` are all served the *same document* — one
canonical is what actually happened rather than a simplification. Emitting a
per-filter canonical would mean reading `searchParams` inside `generateMetadata`,
which was measured to move `/discover` from `○ (Static)` to `ƒ (Dynamic)` in the
build output. A per-request render of the front door is not worth a tag.

**A campaign's card is its own cover photograph when it has one.** §5.3 requires
a cover of at least 1024×576, and an unfurler holding a real photograph should
not be shown typography instead. With no cover — which, until the media pipeline
of §13.1 exists, is most campaigns — the `opengraph-image` route draws the title
and summary onto the site's card. It deliberately embeds no bitmap: Satori
decodes PNG, JPEG, and SVG, while §13.1 serves AVIF first.

**Nothing about a campaign is printed until it is confirmed public.** The
projection is read anonymously, without credentials, because what a link preview
may show is exactly what an anonymous request answers — a card built from an
authenticated read would say more than its audience may see. `PRELAUNCH`,
`SCHEDULED`, `LIVE`, and the five post-funding states are public;
`docs/architecture.md` §6.1's other seven are not, and a campaign in one of them
gets the private shape with no title, no summary, and no cover. A service that
does not answer is treated the same way: a brief `noindex` is re-crawled and
recovers, an indexed draft does not.

**`app/discover/opengraph-image.tsx` is load-bearing.** Next merges a file-based
Open Graph image into the metadata of the segment the file sits in, and a child
segment that declares its own `openGraph` block replaces its parent's resolved one
wholesale. `/discover` declares one, so without a card in its own directory it
would have no `og:image` at all. Any future public route with its own title needs
the same file, or an explicit image.

**Not done here.** `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, and the finer question of which
*public* pages should be indexed are #122's (`lib/seo/indexability.ts`).
`isPubliclyVisible` is the floor both rest on: nothing it refuses may be indexed
or described, whatever that module decides on top.

## Discovery

`/discover` is a client route and its state is the query string. Every filter
and the sort are parameters the service itself defines, so a filtered feed is a
shareable URL (D-12), survives a reload, and comes back off the back button. The
**cursor is deliberately not in the URL**: a shared link should open a fresh
first page rather than page seven of somebody else's scroll, and a cursor is
fingerprinted to the query it was issued for, so one in a link would be answered
`400 DISCOVERY_CURSOR_MISMATCH` the moment the recipient touched a filter.

| Module | Holds |
|---|---|
| `lib/discovery/vocabulary.ts` | The closed vocabularies, copied from `az.ideanest.discovery.domain` |
| `lib/discovery/filters.ts` | The filter state, the URL it serialises to, and the active-chip set |
| `lib/discovery/bounds.ts` | The custom money range, checked with `decimal.js` |
| `lib/discovery/api.ts` | `GET /v1/discover` and `/v1/discover/facets` |
| `lib/discovery/useDiscoveryFeed.ts` | D-04's paging, and the one-request-per-cursor guard |
| `lib/discovery/useDiscoveryFacets.ts` | D-10's live counts |
| `lib/discovery/emptiness.ts` | Which filter emptied the feed |

**Filters the service refuses today are not rendered.** Location (country, city,
proximity), `showOnly=saved`, `showOnly=recommended`, `showOnly=featured`, free
text, `sort=relevance` and `sort=near_me` are all representable on the service's
query object and answered with `400 DISCOVERY_OPTION_UNSUPPORTED` naming the
issue that owns them (#43, #44, #47, #48). A control that cannot work is a
promise the interface breaks the first time somebody uses it, so they are absent
rather than disabled.

**Infinite scroll is the enhancement, not the mechanism.** There is a real
"Show more projects" button and an `IntersectionObserver` that presses it. The
other way round is how a feed becomes unreachable by keyboard and by screen
reader, because neither produces a scroll that intersects anything.

## Sitemaps and robots

`src/lib/seo/` holds one decision — **may this campaign be indexed** — and the
files that act on it.

### The indexability rule

`src/lib/seo/indexability.ts` answers for **all sixteen** project states of
`docs/architecture.md` §6.1, one of three ways. The table is a
`Record<ProjectState, …>`, so a seventeenth state is a type error rather than a
campaign that quietly defaults to indexable, and a state this build has never
heard of is treated as **not public** — it fails closed.

| Answer | States | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `NOT_PUBLIC` | `DRAFT`, `SUBMITTED`, `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, `REJECTED`, `APPROVED`, `SCHEDULED`, `SUSPENDED` | §4.3: discovery never returns these under any filter or sort. The service states the same seven independently as `DiscoveryStatus.HIDDEN_STATES` |
| `PUBLIC_NOT_INDEXABLE` | `PRELAUNCH`, `CANCELED` | Reachable, deliberately not indexed. A pre-launch page is an **unmoderated** teaser — `DRAFT → PRELAUNCH` passes no review — on an id-based URL that stops existing when the campaign opens. A cancelled campaign stays reachable for the backers who have the link, but a permanent search result for a withdrawn campaign is a dead end outranking the live ones beside it |
| `INDEXABLE` | `LIVE`, `LATE_PLEDGE`, `SUCCESSFUL`, `COLLECTING`, `FULFILLING`, `COMPLETED`, `UNSUCCESSFUL` | Public, moderated, and stable — §4.4's project page is the page a backer is looking for |

**One predicate, both surfaces.** `isIndexableProjectState` is what the sitemap
filters on, and `projectPageRobots` is the same decision shaped as a `robots`
meta directive for the campaign page, which renders it since #119. Both read the
same table, so a page that says `noindex` while the sitemap advertises it is not
a state this application can reach — and that state is a crawler being invited to
a page and then turned away from it.

`follow` stays true when `index` is false: a withdrawn campaign still links to
its creator and its category, and those pages are indexable.

### Segmentation

Next's `generateSitemaps` maps `src/app/sitemap.ts` onto `/sitemap/{id}.xml`, one
file per segment, and `src/app/sitemap_index.xml/route.ts` is the
`<sitemapindex>` over them — Next writes no index of its own, and taking
`/sitemap.xml` for a route handler would collide with the metadata route.
`robots.txt` points at the index and not at the segments, so the shard count can
change without a redeployment.

| Segment | Holds |
|---|---|
| `pages` | `/` and `/categories` |
| `discovery` | The unfiltered feed, plus one URL per category and subcategory |
| `projects-N` | Indexable campaigns, 45,000 per shard |

**`discovery` reads the taxonomy at request time** rather than listing it. §4.3
requires the taxonomy to be editable without a deployment, so a frozen array of a
hundred paths is a sitemap that is wrong the first time an administrator renames
anything. `fetchCategories` caches the read for an hour, so a crawl of several
segments costs one request; a read that fails leaves the feed alone in the
segment, because a sitemap that 500s is an error reported against the whole site
and one that is briefly shorter is a sitemap.

**45,000 and not 50,000.** The limit is 50,000 URLs and 50 MB uncompressed, and a
file that breaches either is rejected whole rather than truncated. There is
always at least a `projects-0`, empty if need be: an index referencing a segment
that 404s is an error in Search Console, and a segment whose URL appears and
disappears with the campaign count is one nobody can submit.

Segmenting by content type is not only about size. The three kinds change at
completely different rates, and a crawler can skip a segment whose contents have
not moved — which is impossible to say about a file mixing a campaign that
changes hourly with a page that changes yearly.

### What is claimed about each URL

`lastModified` comes from the campaign's own timestamps: `launchedAt`, and
`deadline` **once it has passed**, because the page changed at that moment from
one taking pledges to one that succeeded or did not. A deadline in the future is
a promise rather than a modification. A campaign with neither gets **no**
`<lastmod>` — `new Date()` would tell a crawler that every page changed on every
crawl, which is how the field comes to be ignored for the whole file. The public
listing carries no `updatedAt`; if one is ever added, this is the one function
that reads it.

`changeFrequency` is a statement about the content and is true: `daily` for a
live campaign, whose amount raised and backer count move every day; `monthly`
through fulfilment, which posts updates over weeks; `yearly` for a page that is
finished.

**There is no `priority`, anywhere, deliberately.** It asks for relative
importance within the site on a scale with no defined meaning, Google states that
it ignores the field, and there is no number here that would be true if it did
not. A field invented to fill a column is a field a reviewer has to pretend to
check.

### What robots.txt refuses

`Allow: /` first and the exceptions after, rather than the reverse — a robots.txt
built the other way round quietly stops indexing every page added after it was
written. The exception list is `PRIVATE_PATH_PREFIXES`, beside the predicate, and
it covers the pledge flow, the campaign editor, the pre-launch teaser, the
account, the creator dashboard, the pledge manager, administration, and the
proxied `/v1` API. **Several of those had no route when the list was written** —
the dashboard and the two admin screens have one now, the account settings shell
(#275) does not yet — and all of them were disallowed from the start anyway: a
private surface has to be disallowed on the deploy that introduces it, and a
robots.txt updated afterwards is updated too late.

`Disallow: /discover?` blocks **every filtered permutation of the feed**. §4.3's
filters are query parameters, they compose, and several are comma-separated
lists, so the number of URLs describing one set of campaigns is combinatorial and
each is crawl budget spent on a page that already exists. That includes `?q=`,
where the URL set is whatever anybody types. `/discover` itself, with no query,
is allowed and is in the sitemap.

`Disallow: /search` blocks WS-06's results route for the same sentence: a
different endpoint with the same property, that the URL space is written by
whoever types in the box. The bare `/search` is disallowed with it rather than
carved out — it holds a form and no content of its own.

`/sign-in`, `/register` and `/verify-email` join the list too. Nothing on them is
worth a crawl, and `/verify-email` carries a single-use credential in its query
string.

### Named gaps

- **`/` resolves now**, and so do the category landing pages. Both were named as
  gaps here: the sitemap emitted `/` before it existed, on the argument that it
  encodes the platform's public URL contract (§4.4, §10.2) rather than an
  inventory of the routes that happen to be built — which is exactly why neither
  the campaign entries (#119) nor this one needed changing when the page landed.
  The category gap read "the only URL reaching one is `/discover?category=games`,
  which `Disallow: /discover?` blocks, and a sitemap must never advertise a URL
  robots.txt blocks"; #265 built the path-based route that closes it.
- **The campaign list is walked, not counted.** There is no endpoint that returns
  a count or a bare list of public project URLs, so the sitemap pages through
  `GET /v1/discover` at `limit=100` — bounded at 500 pages, or 50,000 campaigns —
  and memoises the walk for fifteen minutes. Past that bound the walk is the
  wrong shape and the service needs an endpoint built for it.
- **The sitemap reads the service directly rather than through `publicFetch`.**
  `lib/api/client.ts` issues a same-origin *relative* request, which is what
  makes the `SameSite=Strict` refresh cookie work in a browser and what makes it
  unresolvable in Node, and it attaches an in-memory access token that must never
  ride on a crawl-facing read. The sitemap resolves `/v1/discover` against
  `IDEANEST_API_ORIGIN` — the same variable the proxy uses — and imports its
  response types from `lib/discovery/api.ts` rather than restating them.

## The checkout

`/projects/[id]/back` is the pledge flow of `docs/architecture.md` §4.5 — PL-01
to PL-08 and PL-12. The segment is `back` because that is the reader's word for
what they are doing; `checkout` is ours for the machinery, and it borrows a
shopping cart's model, which is wrong here in a way that matters: nothing is
bought and nothing is charged.

**Three steps, one route, and no query string.** Unlike `/discover`, the state
here is React state. A half-made pledge is not a thing to link to, and a
reservation lives five minutes — a back button that could re-enter the review
step would routinely land on a hold that has gone. The one parameter the route
reads is PL-15's `?token=`, repeatable, which unlocks secret tiers.

| Module | Holds |
|---|---|
| `lib/pledges/api.ts` | The public reward list, the draft, the read, and the confirm |
| `lib/pledges/quote.ts` | PL-06's total, mirroring `PledgeQuote` in `pledge/domain` |
| `lib/pledges/idempotency.ts` | What "the same intent" means, and when a key is retired |
| `lib/pledges/failure.ts` | Each contract refusal, with the recovery that belongs to it |
| `components/checkout/useCheckout.ts` | The selection, the two requests, and the phase |
| `components/checkout/useReservationClock.ts` | PL-13's five minutes, counted down and not animated |

**Two totals, and only one of them is true.** The client quotes the selection
with `decimal.js` so the figure moves as the backer chooses. The moment a draft
comes back, `PledgeResponse.amounts` replaces it outright — the two are never
merged and never shown together. The server prices the row it is about to
reserve, inside the transaction that reserves it; the client is pricing a list it
fetched some seconds ago.

**The idempotency key belongs to an intent, not to an attempt.** A key is issued
per request body, so a retry after a dropped connection sends the same key and is
answered with the same pledge rather than creating a second one. It is retired in
exactly two cases: a reservation that expired — where the body is identical but
the intent is new, and replaying would hand back the draft that just expired —
and a key the service has told us is spent. Going back to change the selection
does **not** retire it, because a backer who changes nothing should get their
existing reservation and its existing clock.

**A collision with your own first attempt is waited out, not reported.** `409
IDEMPOTENT_REQUEST_IN_PROGRESS` is what a double-click produces: the first
request still holds the claim on the key, and the second is told to ask again.
The backer can do nothing about it and their pledge is already being made, so
`useCheckout` waits the `Retry-After` the response carries and sends the **same
key** again — capped at five seconds a wait and three retries, after which the
message says what happened and offers the button. A fresh key on that retry
would be the second pledge this whole mechanism exists to prevent.

| Refusal | What the checkout does |
|---|---|
| `IDEMPOTENT_REQUEST_IN_PROGRESS` | Waits `Retry-After` and re-sends, same key, bounded |
| `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REQUIRED` / `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_INVALID` | Says it is a fault in this page. Neither can happen while `idempotency.ts` sends a `crypto.randomUUID()`, so reaching one is a bug report and not a state a backer can recover from |
| `PLEDGE_MODIFIED` | Offers a new reservation. Usually §8.4's sweep expiring the draft as it was confirmed — the service will not claim a cause it inferred rather than observed, and neither does the wording |

**The confirmation reads the pledge rather than asserting facts about it.**
`cardVerified` and `paymentMethodId` come back on every `PledgeResponse`, and
the "what happens now" sentences are written from them. Both say the same thing
today as the hard-coded prose they replaced — nothing charged, no method
collected — and #55 is precisely the change that would have made that prose a
lie nobody was told to go and fix.

**There is no card form, and adding one would be a defect.** Card entry and 3-D
Secure are #55, blocked on #60 (`status: needs-decision`), so there is no
provider, no hosted field and nothing to tokenise with. `§17.2` targets SAQ A,
which holds only while card data never touches our servers — and a field that
looks like it takes a card teaches somebody that this is where a card goes on
this site. The payment step is an honest note saying nothing is collected, and
`paymentMethodId` is sent as null.

**Confirmation is a commitment, not a payment.** §9.2 collects nothing until the
campaign succeeds, and this build has not even taken a card, so the confirmation
screen says both in as many words.

**Tax is `0.00` and the line is not printed.** `TaxPolicy` holds the zero
deliberately until #78. A permanent "Tax 0.00" row invites the one question the
interface cannot answer; the line appears by itself the day the policy stops
answering zero.

## The campaign editor

The editor is one shell (`src/components/campaign-editor/EditorShell.tsx`) and
one tab per route. `src/components/campaign-editor/tabs.ts` is the only place a
tab is declared: the shell renders that list, and a section whose route does not
exist yet is a **disabled tab rather than a stub page**. A stub cannot be told
apart from a broken page, and the file it would need belongs to the issue that
builds it. Adding a section is a row in `tabs.ts` plus the route it points at.

Every section in `EDITOR_TABS` now has its route, so nothing is currently marked
unavailable. The mechanism stays because `docs/architecture.md` §4.6 describes
three sections that are still unbuilt — people, account, and promotion — and each
of them will be a disabled tab before it is a page.

### The pre-launch tab

It edits the campaign's `title`, `blurb`, and `coverImage` through the same
autosave path the basics tab uses, and not through fields of its own. A dedicated
pre-launch headline would let a creator promise one thing on the page people
follow and something else on the campaign it becomes, and the follower signed up
for the first.

Opening the page is behind a dialog rather than a switch: it publishes the
campaign at a public link, and `docs/architecture.md` §6.1 has no
`PRELAUNCH → DRAFT` edge, so there is no undo to offer afterwards.

### The review tab

`ReviewPanel` reads `GET /v1/projects/{id}/checklist` and renders three things:
the itemised completeness checklist, the last moderation decision, and the submit
control.

**The server is the authority.** The checklist is read when the tab opens;
`POST /submit` re-checks the same rules server-side with the same class. When it
refuses with `PROJECT_NOT_SUBMITTABLE`, the requirements *it* named replace what
the screen was showing — a field may have been emptied by a collaborator since, or
the deployment may enforce a rule this build has never heard of. There is
deliberately no client-side copy of §5.3 here; unlike the basics tab, nothing on
this screen is being typed, so there is nothing an immediate local answer would
buy that a second disagreeing implementation would not cost.

**Blocking and advisory never share a presentation.** Two headed groups, two icon
shapes, and every row states "Done", "Required, not done", or "Recommended, not
done" in text. The score is a sentence with counts — `83% complete. 10 of 10
required items done, 0 of 4 recommended.` — and the bar beside it is
`aria-hidden`, because it is a picture of a number the sentence already carries.

### Autosave

There is no save button below the basics tab. `useAutosave` debounces, keeps a
single request in flight, and only clears its pending patch on a **successful**
response — so a retry after a failure sends the same body rather than an empty
one, and nothing typed is lost. `SaveStatus` reports saving, saved, or not saved,
and announces only the outcomes.

### What the basics tab cannot do yet

| Missing | Why |
|---|---|
| Location | `projects` has no `location_id` and there is no geocoding service. `docs/architecture.md` §7.2 holds both for the discovery epic |
| Uploading a cover image | There is no media table and no uploader. The cover is a URL plus the width and height read in the browser; the media pipeline (§13) replaces all three |
| Video | Same media pipeline, and no client-side equivalent of reading an image's intrinsic size |
| Changing the category | Needs `GET /v1/categories`, which no sub-issue of the editor epic owns. The field degrades to a notice and everything else still saves |

## How authentication works here

The access token lives in a module variable in `src/lib/api/access-token.ts` and
nowhere else. It is a fifteen-minute bearer credential — `localStorage` would
hand it to any script that ever runs on the page and outlive the tab for no
benefit. The durable half of the session is the refresh cookie, which script
cannot read by design.

`authorizedFetch` attaches the token, and on a `401` refreshes once and retries
once. Refresh is single-flight: refresh tokens rotate on use and a reused one is
treated as stolen, so two concurrent refreshes would end the session family
between them.

**The two helpers cache differently, and neither serves a stale body.**
`authorizedFetch` sends `cache: 'no-store'`: an account read carries no validator
to revalidate against, so storing the response buys nothing and a stale device
list on a security screen is the one thing that page must never show.
`publicFetch` sends `cache: 'no-cache'`, which still forces a revalidation on
every single request but lets that revalidation be conditional. Public reads
carry `ETag` and `Cache-Control` per `docs/architecture.md` §10.3 — the reward
list is `private, no-cache` — so an unchanged list is answered `304` with no body
instead of re-sending every tier, item and shipping rule on each poll of a live
stock count. `no-store` here would make that `304` unreachable, which is what
#200 fixed.

### The second factor, and the two provider buttons

`POST /v1/auth/login` and `POST /v1/auth/oauth/{provider}` are answered by the same
`respondTo` on the service, so **either can return a two-factor challenge instead of a
session**. `useSignInOutcome` is the one place that branch is taken, shared by the password
form and both provider buttons on both `/sign-in` and `/register`; a component that handled it
in one place and forgot it in another would not fail loudly, it would call `refresh()`, find no
session, and leave somebody on a form that appeared to do nothing.

The provider SDKs are fetched **on the first interaction**, not on render: together they are a
couple of hundred kilobytes of third-party JavaScript that most visitors to a sign-in page
never use, and the two screens they sit on take the minimal shell for the same reason.
`src/lib/auth/script.ts` owns the loading.

Google's own button is rendered rather than one of ours, and the asymmetry is theirs: Google
Identity Services no longer offers a reliable way to raise a credential prompt from a click —
One Tap is browser-arbitrated through FedCM and is suppressed after a dismissal — so
`renderButton` is the supported path for a custom sign-in surface. Apple exposes
`AppleID.auth.signIn()`, a promise a click can call, so Apple gets an ordinary `Pill`.

### Named gaps in the account area

| Gap | What it costs | Whose it is |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /v1/me` carries no `twoFactorEnabled` | `/settings/security` cannot say whether two-factor is already on. It offers both paths and lets `POST /2fa/enable` answer — the service refuses an enrolled account with a sentence written for its owner, and the panel moves to the off-path on it | §17, not this epic |
| No `PATCH /v1/me` | The profile editor (#276) has nowhere to save, so there is no entry for it in the account navigation | The user module |
| `GET /v1/users/{slug}` carries no counts | The profile's two tabs cannot print "12 campaigns" above a list; they print the list. Answering the counts inside the user module would give the module every other module depends on a dependency on `project` and `pledge` in turn, and a `total` on each list would sit above a shorter one on the backed tab, which drops what the reader may not see | Decided, not a gap — `PublicProfiles` carries the argument |
| No creator biography beyond `users.bio` | The Creator tab (#282) has a bio, an avatar and the campaigns this account has launched. §4.4 also asks for history and contact, and there is no column for either | The user module |
| A suspended account still has a public profile | §4.11's AD-04 stops an account and does not retract the campaigns it launched, so withdrawing the index while publishing everything it indexes would be a half-measure. Whether a suspension should hide the profile is a product question nobody has been asked | Needs a decision |

Three rows left this table when #271, #274 and #287 landed: `GET /v1/users/{slug}`,
`POST /v1/auth/forgot-password` and `GET /v1/me/pledges` are all built. What they
unblocked is in the sections above.

## Real user monitoring

`src/lib/rum/` measures LCP, INP, CLS, TTFB and FCP on real devices and posts
them to `POST /api/rum` (#128). `docs/observability/real-user-monitoring.md` is
the full account — the thresholds, the sampling reasoning, the privacy rules,
what a production sink would have to be, and the named gaps. The short version:

**Field, not lab.** `apps/web/performance/` measures Core Web Vitals in
Lighthouse on a CI runner; this measures them on the devices people actually
use. Both use Google's published good/needs-improvement boundaries, and
`src/lib/rum/metrics.test.ts` reads `performance/summarise-lighthouse.mjs` and
fails if the two stop agreeing. INP appears only here — a headless load performs
no interaction, so no lab tool can report one.

**p75, nearest rank**, because that is how Core Web Vitals is defined and
because an interpolated percentile is a headline figure no session experienced.

**Nothing that identifies a person.** No URL — a Next route pattern from a fixed
whitelist, so a campaign identifier and a search term cannot leave the browser.
No query string, no account, no user agent, no stored IP address, and no field a
free string can enter. Two locks: the schema refuses unknown keys and validates
every value against a closed vocabulary, and §17.4's shape rules then run over
what is left.

**Session-consistent sampling**, defaulting to every session, because a p75 over
a few hundred samples moves by more between two ordinary days than a regression
would move it — and there is no production traffic to sample down from yet. A
coin flip per metric would rank metrics rather than visits and produce something
with the shape of a p75 that is not one.

**`sendBeacon`, falling back to `fetch(…, { keepalive: true })`.** The metrics
worth having are final only as the page goes away, which is exactly when a
browser cancels requests. Reporting a metric does nothing but push onto an
array; the send happens in an idle callback, or synchronously on `pagehide`.
`<WebVitals />` renders `null`, so there is no element, no motion, and nothing
that could shift the layout it is measuring.

**It joins the server's traces.** `instrumentation-client.ts` puts the session's
W3C `traceparent` on every same-origin `/v1` request, using the identifiers
`docs/architecture.md` §18.1 already defines, so a slow field session and its
server spans share a `traceId`. It never overwrites a header a caller set, so
the day `lib/api/client.ts` does this itself, this stops.

**No analytics vendor is introduced.** Accepted samples become one JSON line per
sample on stdout, beside the application's other lines. §14.2 lists product
analytics as a choice not yet made, and it stays not yet made.

```bash
pnpm --filter @ideanest/web dev
curl http://localhost:3000/api/rum        # the p75 table, in development
```

## Styling

`src/app/globals.css` imports `@ideanest/ui/styles.css` and nothing else. That
one import brings Tailwind, the token file, and the theme bridge, so this
application defines no colour of its own — see `docs/ui-kit.md` §10.1, where a
test fails the build on a colour literal.

### Fonts

`src/app/layout.tsx` loads Inter through `next/font/google` and binds it to
`--font-inter` on `<html>`; the theme bridge in `@ideanest/ui/styles.css` reads
that variable for `--font-sans` and `--font-display`. Next self-hosts the files
out of `/_next/static/media`, so there is no request to a third origin and no
blocking round trip before the browser learns which `.woff2` to fetch.

**Only `latin` and `latin-ext` are declared, and both are needed.** Google's
`latin` cut carries `ı`, `ö`, `ü` and `ç`, but `ə` (U+0259), `Ə`, `ğ`, `Ğ`, `ş`,
`Ş` and `İ` live in `U+0100-02BA`, which only `latin-ext` declares. A missing `ə`
is a broken product in this market, so `src/app/font-subsets.test.ts` fails if
the list stops covering those code points, and fails again if one of the
`cyrillic`, `greek` or `vietnamese` cuts is added — each one is another file
preloaded against the largest contentful paint.

Those two are the **only** preloads on the page. They earn it: every glyph above
the fold is set in this family. `adjustFontFallback` is left at its default, so
Next synthesises a metric-matched local fallback and the `display: 'swap'` does
not move the layout — which is what keeps cumulative layout shift inside the
0.05 `docs/motion-system.md` §8 asks for.

Weight is the full variable axis rather than the four weights `docs/ui-kit.md`
§5.3 names. Google serves Inter v20 as a variable file either way: asking for
`wght@400;500;600;700` returns the same two subset files 380 bytes smaller, so
pinning would buy nothing and would break the first `font-bold` somebody adds.

`--font-display` still asks for General Sans first, which `docs/ui-kit.md` §5.1
makes the first choice for display and headings. It is a Fontshare licence and a
vendored binary rather than a build-time download, so until somebody makes that
call the stack resolves to Inter — the substitution §5.1 names itself.
