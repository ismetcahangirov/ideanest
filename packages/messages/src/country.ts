 * Which language a first visit from a given country starts in — issue #125.

 * <h2>Why a country and not `Accept-Language`</h2>
 *
 * `routing.ts` turned next-intl's header negotiation off, and the reason still holds: a
 * response that varies by `Accept-Language` splits the shared cache per browser
 * configuration. The country is read only where nothing is cached anyway — the `307` on a
 * path with no language in it — so the localised pages it sends people to stay one cached
 * document each.
 *
 * <h2>Where the country comes from</h2>
 *
 * Cloudflare, which proxies `ideanest.az`, adds `CF-IPCountry` to every request it
 * forwards: an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, `XX` when it does not know, `T1` for Tor. Nothing
 * here looks the address up itself, so a request that did not come through Cloudflare —
 * local development, a health probe — simply has no country and gets the default.
 *
 * A client can send the header itself. That is harmless by construction: the only thing it
 * decides is which language that same client is redirected to.

 *
 * Every country not listed here gets `DEFAULT_LOCALE`, which is why this is a table of
 * exceptions rather than a table of every country.
