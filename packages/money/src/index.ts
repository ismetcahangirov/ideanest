 * near arithmetic or a comparison is a `Decimal`, and it crosses the API as a
 * string — never as a JSON number, which is an IEEE 754 double and cannot hold
 * `599.00` exactly (docs/architecture.md §10.3).
 *
 * `parseFloat` and `Number()` are absent from this module on purpose. Both
 * silently accept `'1e5'`, `'0x10'`, `'12abc'`, and `Infinity`, and both lose
 * precision on the way in — so a string that has already been through them can
 * never be trusted again.
 *
 * No global `Decimal.set()` here. This module only parses, compares, and
 * formats to a fixed scale, none of which needs a precision or rounding mode;
 * configuring the constructor globally from a leaf module would change the
 * behaviour of every other consumer that imports it.
