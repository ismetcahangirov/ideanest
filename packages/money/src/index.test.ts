 *     fifty dollars. Multiplying instead of dividing gives $85.00, and on a
 *     rate near one nobody notices until somebody pledges in lira.
 *   * **Precision.** 0.0354 manat per lira. A rate rounded to two decimal
 *     places is 0.04, which makes a ₼50 campaign look 13% cheaper than it is.
 *
 * Everything else here is the same rule stated once: an approximation that
 * cannot be computed honestly is absent, never a fallback.
