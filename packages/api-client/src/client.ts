/**
 * A typed reader for the IdeaNest API — #136.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is hand-written and tiny</h2>
 *
 * The types in `schema.ts` are generated and are the valuable half. What is here is the
 * fifty lines that turn `paths['/v1/discover']['get']` into a function call, and it is
 * deliberately not a library.
 *
 * `openapi-fetch` would do the same job. It was not taken because this package is imported
 * by `@ideanest/web`, whose First Load JS is a budget CI fails on
 * (`apps/web/performance/check-first-load-js.mjs`), and by a React Native application that
 * does not exist yet. A runtime dependency in a package both of them import is a dependency
 * neither of them can drop, in exchange for behaviour that fits on one screen.
 *
 * Zero dependencies is also what makes this usable from a Next.js Server Component, from a
 * browser, and from Hermes without a polyfill: the only global it touches is `fetch`, and
 * that is injectable.
 *
 * <h2>What it does not do</h2>
 *
 * **No token handling, no refresh, no retry.** `apps/web/src/lib/api` owns those, because
 * they are decisions about a session rather than about a request: the fifteen-minute access
 * token, the `SameSite=Strict` refresh cookie, and the rule that a second 401 is a refusal
 * rather than an expiry are all properties of the web client's own auth flow, and mobile's
 * will differ. This takes headers and returns bodies.
 *
 * **Only reads, for now.** Every method below is a `GET`. Writes on this platform carry
 * `Idempotency-Key` (§10.3), and a client that made it easy to send a payment mutation
 * without one would be the wrong shape for the one rule that matters most. When a write
 * belongs here it arrives with that header in its signature.
