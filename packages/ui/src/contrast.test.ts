/**
 * Contrast, as arithmetic rather than as a promise — issue 129.
 *
 * <p>The issue number is written without its hash on purpose: `design-tokens.test.ts` scans
 * every file in this package for hex literals, and a three-digit one is a valid colour.
 * `src/server.ts` writes "issue 119" for the same reason.
 *
 * `CLAUDE.md` §2 says "contrast failures are build errors, not warnings", and until this
 * existed nothing computed one. `design-tokens.test.ts` enforces that every colour comes from
 * the token file; this enforces that the pairs the system actually draws are legible once they
 * get there.
 *
 * <h2>Why here and not in a browser</h2>
 *
 * A rendered check needs a layout engine, and the automated pass in `apps/web` runs under
 * jsdom, which computes no styles — axe's `color-contrast` rule is inert there and is disabled
 * with a note saying so. The token file is where the decision is made, so it is where the
 * arithmetic belongs: a pairing that fails here fails on every surface that uses it, before a
 * component exists to be reviewed.
 *
 * <h2>The translucent tokens are composited first</h2>
 *
 * `textSecondary` is `rgba(255,255,255,0.64)`, which has no contrast ratio of its own — what a
 * reader sees is that white composited over whichever surface is behind it. So every ratio
 * below is computed against a named background, and the same token is checked more than once
 * because the answer genuinely differs: `text-white/64` is comfortable on `--surface-1` and
 * illegible on lime, which is the mistake `docs/ui-kit.md` warns about in as many words.
 *
 * <h2>What the thresholds are</h2>
 *
 * WCAG 2.2 AA: <strong>4.5:1</strong> for body text, <strong>3:1</strong> for large text
 * (18.66px bold or 24px regular) and for non-text essentials — a focus ring, a control's
 * border, the filled part of a progress bar. The system's tertiary text is deliberately below
 * 4.5 and is only ever used at a size that qualifies as large or for text that repeats
 * information stated elsewhere; the cases are named individually rather than waved through by
 * a lower blanket threshold.
