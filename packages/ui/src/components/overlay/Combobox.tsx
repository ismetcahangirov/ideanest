/**
 * A text input with a listbox popup — ARIA's combobox, in the shape
 * docs/ui-kit.md §7.13 reserved for it.
 *
 * §7.13 calls the native `<select>` a decision rather than a shortcut and sends
 * "the rich listbox — multi-select, async search" to overlay work instead. This
 * is that overlay: options arrive from somewhere else, asynchronously, and the
 * reader is typing rather than choosing from a fixed vocabulary. Nothing here
 * replaces `Select`, and a control with five fixed options must still use it.
 *
 * CONTROLLED, like every other overlay (§7.14). `value`, `open`, and the option
 * list are the caller's; what is *active* inside the list is not, because it is
 * a property of one keyboard walk rather than application state.
 *
 * DOM FOCUS NEVER LEAVES THE INPUT. The active option is named by
 * `aria-activedescendant` and nothing else. Moving real focus into the list is
 * the version of this control that cannot be typed into: every keystroke after
 * the first arrow press would go to an `<li>`, and the reader would have to
 * find their way back to correct a typo.
 *
 * NO INLINE COMPLETION. Arrowing through the options does not rewrite what was
 * typed — `aria-autocomplete="list"`, not `"both"`. Two reasons. The typed text
 * is what a plain Enter submits, and a control that quietly replaces it makes
 * "search for what I typed" unreachable once the reader has looked at the list.
 * And the options here are not all completions of the fragment: a list that
 * mixes a campaign title with a category name would write a category name into
 * the box and then submit it as free text.
 *
 * THE ACTIVE OPTION WRAPS. Down from the last option lands on the first and Up
 * from the first lands on the last. The list is bounded and short — ten rows —
 * so a wrap costs one keypress and a hard stop costs the reader the discovery
 * that the list ended. Escape, not Up, is how the list is left.
 *
 * HOME AND END NAVIGATE THE LIST ONLY ONCE THE LIST IS BEING NAVIGATED — that
 * is, only while an option is active. Before that they are the caret shortcuts
 * they are in every other text field, because a reader fixing the first letter
 * of what they typed must not be thrown into a dropdown to do it.
 *
 * TAB LEAVES WITHOUT SELECTING. It closes the popup and moves on; it does not
 * accept the active option. Tab means "I am done here", and a control that
 * commits a highlighted row on the way past is one that changes the page when
 * somebody was only trying to reach the next control.
 *
 * MOTION: none. The popup appears and disappears. docs/motion-system.md §5.1
 * gives the filter rail "150ms colour only" because "a panel that animates
 * while somebody is using it is a panel that is slower to use", and a
 * suggestion list is that panel with a keyboard in it — it is read between two
 * keystrokes.

        announced as loudly as three of them, because silence from a control
        that was just typed into reads as a control that has broken.

        It does not talk over the typing echo: the text changes when a list
        arrives, and a debounced caller produces one of those per burst of
        keystrokes rather than one per key.

        `aria-live` WITHOUT `role="status"`, and that is deliberate. The two
        announce identically, but `status` is a page-level role, and a page
        typically has one — the feed's, on `/discover`. A widget that claimed it
        too would put a second "status" in the document, so "the status" would
        no longer identify anything: not for a reader navigating by role, and
        not for the tests that query by it either.
