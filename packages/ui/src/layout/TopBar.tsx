/**
 * Collapsing top navigation. See docs/ui-kit.md §8.6 and docs/motion-system.md §4.7.
 *
 * Three things change together on scroll — width narrows, the pill picks up a
 * white surface, padding tightens — all on the same 300ms curve. The effect is
 * that navigation is absent at the top of the page and materialises as you move.
 *
 * `position: sticky` is used rather than `fixed` so the bar participates in
 * layout and never covers the first focusable element.
 *
 * ONLY `transform` AND `opacity` MOVE — issue 166. This bar used to transition the
 * row's `padding` and the pill's `max-width`, which laid out every page again on
 * every frame of the collapse, on every scroll. The layout now changes in one step
 * and the motion is drawn over it:
 *
 * - The white surface is a layer of its own behind the links, and it fades in with
 *   `opacity`. The pill keeps a transparent 1px border in both states, so its size
 *   does not depend on the surface.
 * - The row's children move by FLIP: where each one is drawn is read just before the
 *   change, the new layout is applied, and each child starts from where it was with a
 *   `transform` that runs out to nothing over 300ms. The end state is the same markup
 *   it always was, so the collapsed header looks exactly as it did.
 *
 * The FLIP transform exists only while it runs. A transform left on the row at rest
 * would make it the containing block of every `position: fixed` descendant, and the
 * web app's mobile drawer is one: it would open inside the header, not over the page.
 *
 * Reduced motion: the surface's transition is removed with `motion-reduce:`, and the
 * FLIP is not started at all, because a Web Animation does not read the stylesheet's
 * reduced-motion rule the way a CSS transition does.
