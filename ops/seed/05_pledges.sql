-- Pledges, and the money that followed them.
--
-- HOW MANY BACKERS EACH CAMPAIGN GETS IS DERIVED, NOT TYPED. A funding
-- percentage is the number a visitor actually reads, so this file states the
-- percentage it wants and works backwards to a headcount through the weighted
-- average of that campaign's own reward tiers. Typing "620 backers" instead
-- would mean re-deriving the percentage by hand every time a tier price
-- changed, and the two would drift apart the first time nobody bothered.
--
-- The weights are the shape of a real tier list: the second-cheapest tier takes
-- the largest share, the top tier takes almost none.

-- ONE TRANSACTION, AND IT HAS TO BE. ledger_entries carries a deferred
-- constraint trigger that checks each transaction's postings sum to zero at
-- COMMIT. Under psql's autocommit every INSERT would be its own transaction,
-- and the first one -- the escrow debits, with no matching credits yet -- would
-- fail on its own. The temp tables want the same scope.
