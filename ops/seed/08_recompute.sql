-- Every figure here exists twice in the schema: once as the pledges themselves
-- and once as a counter on the project. That is a deliberate denormalisation —
-- a card cannot afford to sum three thousand pledges — but it means the seed
-- has exactly one honest way to set it, which is to compute it. A pledged
-- amount typed by hand is a number that disagrees with the backer list on the
-- creator dashboard, and there is no way to tell which one is wrong.
