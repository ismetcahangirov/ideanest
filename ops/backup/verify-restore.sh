# Decide whether a restored cluster is actually correct.
#
# The reason this file is longer than the one that performs the restore: a
# server that starts is not a restore that worked. A truncated archive, a
# recovery that stopped early, a base backup from before a migration, an
# archive whose last segments were never written — every one of those produces
# a PostgreSQL that accepts connections and answers queries. §19.4 asks for a
# rehearsal that is "measured and documented", and a rehearsal that measures
# only uptime documents nothing.
#
# So this asks the questions an operator would ask if they had all night:
#
#   recovery-complete       the cluster is promoted, not still following the
#                           archive, and it is on a new timeline
#   target-time-respected   nothing committed after the recovery target is here
#   schema-history          Flyway's history is intact and at the version the
#                           repository expects
#   relations-present       every table the migrations create exists
#   audit-append-only       V21's trigger survived the restore and still refuses
#                           a DELETE. A revoked grant would not have survived,
#                           which is the argument V21 makes and this proves
#   ledger-self-test        the imbalance detector below detects an imbalance
#   ledger-balance          §7.2's invariant holds over every transaction
#   referential-integrity   no orphaned row anywhere in the schema
#   atomicity               no prepared transaction, no invalid index, no
#                           unvalidated constraint, and the witness pair written
#                           by one transaction is present or absent as a pair
#   witness-before-present  a row committed before the target is here
#   witness-after-absent    a row committed after the target is not
#   physical-integrity      pg_amcheck finds no corrupt heap page or index
#   data-checksums          the cluster can detect a corrupt page at all
#
# Exit status is 0 only when every check that ran passed. Anything else is a
# failed drill, and a failed drill is an incident in slow motion.
